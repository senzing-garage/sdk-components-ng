:import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { SenzingSdkModule } from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from

dynamically change the global\nvalues that are passed throughout all components for API connection requests.\nThis service is provided for advanced usage where the connection parameters have to\nchange dynamically through the application lifecycle(ie changing request namespace from 'http://api.mydomain.com' to 'http://api.mydomain.com/SUBSECTION').\nIf your application just needs its values initialized that should be done by\npassing in a config factory to the SenzingSdkModule method.\nExample :this.apiconf.basePath = 'http://apis.mydomain.com/';Example :this.apiconf.parametersChanged.subscribe( (params) => { console.log('api connection params changed.', params); })\n            \n\n\n\n            \n    Index\n    \n        \n                \n

NOTE: This field is absent or null if there are no results.\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        pageSize\n                                            \n                                                \n                                            \n                                        \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        pageSize:         number\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :         number\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    The requested page size representing the maximum number of  SzRelation's' that were included in the page.\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        sampleSize\n                                            \n                                                \n                                            \n                                        \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        sampleSize:         number\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :         number\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    The requested sample size representing the number of SzRelation's to be randmonly selected from the page of results.\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        totalRelationCount\n                                            \n                                                \n                                            \n                                        \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        totalRelationCount:         number\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :         number\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    The total number of relationships representing the set of all  possible results across all pages.\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n            \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"pipes/SzDecimalPercentPipe.html":{"url":"pipes/SzDecimalPercentPipe.html","title":"pipe -

datastore.\nevery time a pref in the datastore is changed publishes a\n\"prefsChanged\" rxjs BehaviorSubject  that can be subscribed\nand responded to.\nwhen a component UI event happens(ie: user collapses all nodes in an entity detail section)\nthe component updates the corresponding value through this service.\nrepresentational state is published and responded to through this class.\nit is up to the end consumer what to do with this data. it is not stored anywhere\nother than in memory by default. the third example shows how to load from localstorage.\nExample :constructor(private prefs: SzPrefsService) {\n    this.prefs.prefsChanged.subscribe((prefs: SzSdkPrefsModel) => { console.log('prefs changed!', prefs); })\n}Example :constructor(private prefs: SzPrefsService) {\n

project will be documented in this file.\nThe format is based on Keep a Changelog,\nmarkdownlint,\nand this project adheres to Semantic Versioning.\n[7.0.0] - 2024-10-04\nThe 7.0.0 release features several new components that use the new DataMart interface(statistics calculation api) made available only in the Senzing POC API Server. Using the Senzing REST API Sever without the new components(data sample browsing, and datasource's summary, Cross-Source comparison) is still possible but not advised for brand new installations.\nModified\n\nWhy and Why Not reports now show scores for all scoring features regardless of match key inclusion. #686\nGraph datasource colors can now be unselected by choosing pure white or black using the color picker. #690\nWhy not modal could not horizontally scroll properly. #588\nGraph filter switch for \"Directly Related Only\" removed in due to confusion between it and the \"Hide Indirect Links\" checkbox. #590\nOn \"Why\" screen the best matching value should be at the top on the left. #592\n\"Re-Eval\" button incorrectly showing up for singleton entities in the detail widget. #606\n\nAdded\n\nDonut chart that breaks down how many records have been loaded for each datasource. #608\n\nAdded SzRecordStatsDonutChart component.\nAdded SzDataMartService service to interact with poc-server endpoints\nAdded SzCountStatsForDataSourcesResponse, SzStatCountsForDataSources, SzRecordCountDataSource models\nList widget that shows how many records have been loaded for each datasource.\nAdded SzShortNumberPipe to display the amount of records in the shortest format ie 12060 records will show 12.1K etc\nAdded  SzDecimalPercentPipe to format percent values from decimal inputs.\n\n\nLicense wiget showing the current license expiry, record limit and how close a particular install is to it's limits. #616\n\nSzLicenseInfoComponent component to show the current expiration and limit of license and how many records have been loaded so far.\n\n\nVenn Diagram cross-source comparison chart. Shows how many records of each type(duplicates, possible relations, disclosed etc) are present in each datasource selected and the amount of each present in both selected datasources(the overlapping part of the diagram). #614\n\nSzCrossSourceSummaryComponent is responsible for drawing the five venn diagrams. each of which are instances of SzVennDiagramsComponent.\nSzVennDiagramsComponent displays a single circle if only one datasource is selected, or two circles if two datasources are selected with the overlapping part of the circle being the  records that are present in both datasources.\nSzCrossSourceStatistics is a wrapper that contains both the pulldowns AND the venn diagrams\nSzCrossSourceSelectComponent - this is a component wrapper for the select pulldowns themselves that allow a user to select two datasources to display in the venn diagrams.\nSzDataMartService the service used to coordinate between components which datasources are selected, make api requests, set preferences etc.\nSzDataMartPrefs stores state for parameters of the service/components and emits on changes.\nSzElementResizeObserverDirective allows listening for resize events on dom elements. (used for setting the width of pulldowns to the same as the width of the visible pulldown control which is responsive)\n\n\nSample set Data Table. The new Data Table component shows a sampleset of particular types of records for a specific datasource or datasources and allows paging through the result set. #627\n\nSzTooltipComponent tooltip that floats above collapsed or limited table cells spawned by the SzTooltipDirective attribute.\n SzCrossSourceResultsDataTable\nSzCrossSourceSelectComponent\nSzOrderedMapEntries\nSzDataMartPrefs stores persistent preferences like default selected data sources, match level etc.\nSzDataTable generic component that can be fed data and displays data with formatting in a tabular format.\nSzCrossSourceResultsDataTable extends SzDataTable with functions and properties specific to displaying the sample results of cross source analysis query.\nSzCrossSourcePagingComponent is a paging component for navigating through the sampling data table results.\nSzCrossSourceStatistics Wrapper component for the comparing stats of one datasource with their mutual stat type of another datasource. Uses the Venn Diagram chart to show the overlap and a special Data Table specific to displaying a sample set from the selected type of stats for the two selected data sources.\n\n\nThe following events types have been added:\n\nSzStatsSampleTableLoadingEvent\nSzCrossSourceSummarySelectionEvent\nSzCrossSourceSummarySelectionClickEvent\nsampleDataSourceChangeEvent\nSzStatSampleSetPageChangeEvent\nSzDataTableCellEvent\n\n\nThe following enums have been added:\n\nSzCrossSourceSummaryCategoryType\nSzStatSampleEntityTableRowType\nSzCrossSourceSummaryCategoryTypeToMatchLevel\n\n\nThe following models have been added:\n\nSzStatSampleEntityTableItem\n\nSzDataTableEntity\n\nSzDataTableRelatedEntity\n\nSzStatSampleEntityTableRowEntity\n\nSzStatSampleEntityTableRow\n\nSzDataTableRelationsPagingParameters\n\nSzDataTableEntitiesPagingParameters\n\nSzStatSampleSetParameters\n\nSzCrossSourceSummaryRequests\n\nSzCrossSourceSummaryResponses\n\nSzCrossSourceCount\n\n\nrelevant tickets: #588 #590 #592 #606 #608 #614 #616 #627 #690 #689\n[6.1.0] - 2023-09-06\nThe major feature being added for this release is the inclusion a a new \"How\" report component. The How api functions are meant to provide information on HOW records in an entity came together or were pushed apart during resolution. The Visual How component will illustrate the final entity and allow the user to walk back through the entities resolution steps, branching off when singletons are merged in or virtual entities are created from the result of previous record resolution steps.\nModified\n\nnew graph icons. see #499\nmatch keys are now shown by default in the graph. #496\nnew why and why not report column formatting to match g2Explorer. #558 #551\nwhy and why not datatransforms changed to match g2Explorer. #529\n\nAdded\n\n\"How\" entity report component(s) added. see #438\nAdded SzHowEntityComponent component which is the only component that should be used at an implementation level. The other components listed below are components that this component uses to create things like different color cards, nested trees, navigation, groups etc.\nAdded SzHowNavComponent component which is used to provide quick step jumping based on filter criteria.\nAdded SzHowStepNodeComponent component which represents a node in the step tree. Nodes are different that Steps since they can be other trees, groups, and recurse. Step nodes will contain SzHowStepCardComponent, SzHowStepStackComponent, SzHowFinalEntityCardComponent, SzHowSingletonCardComponent, and/or nested SzHowStepNodeComponent components.\nAdded SzHowStepStackComponent component which represents a collapsible group of ADD Record steps found in sequence.\nAdded SzHowStepCardBase which serves as a base class for card permutations.\nSzHowStepCardComponent is the card component representing a Add Record, Singleton, Merge, Interim.\nSzHowSingletonCardComponent represents a step or a non-resolved state with a single record that was not merged in.\nSzHowFinalEntityCardComponent represents the top level node for a final state in a tree.\n\n\n\n\n\"How\" UI service(SzHowUIService) that provides inter-op, eventing, and caching for different How components to use a shared service so things only need to be parsed/transformed once, and if something changes all the components can be notified etc.\n\nrelevant tickets: #438 #496 #499 #513 #516 #525 #527 #529 #531 #534 #538 #545 #547 #548 #551 #555 #557 #558 #565 #567 #571 #572 #574 #581\n[6.0.0] - 2023-01-20\nModified\n\nAngular Framework updated to version 15. As of 6.0.0 release this package now requires @angular@~15.0.0 to compile and run. Updating to angular 15 resolves major dependency compatibility issues so we can apply the latest security patches to the library. For information updating your project from a previous angular version to ~15.0.0 see the Angular Update Guide \nAngular Material updated to version 15. As of 6.0.0 release this package now requires v15 of angular material library. Since the compiled version of this package defines it's dependency as a peer dependency it's worth mentioning that your project will need to import it to function properly. ng add @angular/material@15.\nD3.js updated to version 7. version 5 was exposing a security defect in d3.color(see SNYK-JS-D3COLOR-1076592) that had no patches available until version 7. see #466\n\nRemoved\n\nforceSimulation property removed from SzRelationshipNetworkComponent base class. (no one should be directly using this anyways)\n\n[5.1.1] - 2022-10-31\nAdded\n\nAdded \"hide indirect links\" UI control to graph filtering component.\nAdded suppressL1InterLinks to graph preferences\nAdded linkColor to graph preferences\nAdded indirectLinkColor to graph preferences\nAdded Link Color section to graph filter component\nAdded Data Sources list to graph hover tooltip\nAdded \"Why Not\" button/report to \"Possible Matches\" section in the entity detail component.\n\nModified\n\nMatch keys on graph entity link(s) are now in a vertically centered multi-line list.\nBugfix for match key labels. (see #383)\nEntity detail embedded graph now defaults to collapsed nodes when relationships are \nshowMatchKeys UI/UX parameter renamed to showLinkLabels to avoid confusion with matchKeyFilters and showMatchKeyTokens which are functional/behavior parameters.\nGraph api call pattern changed to an initial entity request followed by a minimal entity-networks call to retrieve the necessary data. This new surface pattern dramatically decreases the time needed to initially render a graph with a large about of relationships.\nGraph entity name label no longer clips with ellipsis.\nGraph entity name now performs a hard word wrap to display the full name on multiple lines\n\nrelevant tickets: #309 #364 #383 #407 #413 #414 #415 #416 #417 #422 #423 #432 #433 #436 #439\n[5.1.0] - 2022-07-27\n\nthere is now a new unlimited ui option for maximum entities allowed.\nthere is now a new unlimited ui option for maximum build out allowed.\nthe upper limit of the maximum entities ui slider is now dynamically set from the initial query.\nmatch key token counts now feature condensed notation instead of ellipsis.\n\nAdded\n\nthe following event emitters added to SzGraphFilterComponent\nmatchKeyTokenSelectionScopeChanged when the user switches from CORE to EXTRANEOUS match key token scope\n\n\nthe following getters and setters added to SzGraphFilterComponent\nmaxEntitiesLimit the maximum value that the slider control will allow. default is 200.\nunlimitedMaxEntities ignore the maxEntities value and always pull up to 40000\nunlimitedMaxScope ignore the buildOut value and always pull up to 10\n\n\nthe following getters and setters added to SzGraphComponent\nunlimitedMaxEntities\nunlimitedMaxScope\nmaxEntitiesFilterLimit\n\n\nthe following event emitters on SzGraphComponent\nrenderStarted not sure why this didn't exist since renderComplete did\ndataLoading for more flexible state sensing\nonPreflightRequestComplete so we can get the total relationship count to populate the maxEntitiesFilterLimit\n\n\nthe following properties/getters/setters added to SzRelationshipNetworkComponent\nnoMaxEntitiesLimit sets whether or not to ignore the value set in maxEntities\nnoMaxScopeLimit sets whether or not to ignore the value set in buildOut\n\n\nthe following event emitters added to SzRelationshipNetworkComponent\nonTotalRelationshipsCountUpdated is emitted with the value of how many total relationships are possible to display according to the data in the focal entities related entities.\nrenderStarted wasn't wired correctly. works now\ndataLoading when a data request has been initiated.\ndataLoaded which is like requestComplete but instead of a boolean it returns the data response\n\n\nthe following preferences added to SzGraphPrefs\nunlimitedMaxEntities\nunlimitedMaxScope\n\n\ngetEntitiesByIds method added to SzSearchService to get data for multiple entities by their id's in the form of Observable\n\nModified\n\nChanged the behavior of showCoreMatchKeyTokenChips to automatically set matchKeyTokenSelectionScope to CORE.\nChanged the complete match key display to a comma deliminated list of tokens on each line for readability\nChanged the shouldDataSourceBeDisplayed method in SzGraphFilterComponent to allow for passing an empty array to showDataSources so we can initialize with an empty list that will prevent showing datasources before the list is ready.\nChanged the SzStandaloneGraphComponent component to initialize the value of showDataSources in the filter component to NOT initially show data sources until the data can be properly rendered. (prevents FOC, see above)\nthe following getters and setters added to SzGraphFilterComponent\nmaxEntities the maximum number of entities to display on the graph\n\n\nthe following changes made to SzRelationshipNetworkComponent\ndataRequested changed to BehaviorSubject (lifecycle bugfix)\nrequestStarted fixed\nrequestComplete fixed\ngetNetwork signature changed to getNetwork(entityIds: SzEntityIdentifier[], maxDegrees: number, buildOut: number, maxEntities: number)\nthe following event emitters have been rewired so that they are just proxies of \nthe observeable event streams for uniformity/reliability:\nonRequestStarted\nonRequestCompleted\nonRenderStarted\nonRenderCompleted\nonNoResults\nonDataRequested\nonDataLoaded\nonDataUpdated\nscaleChanged\n\n\n\n\n\nrelevant tickets: #343 #344 #347 #348 #350 #355 #358\n[5.0.0] - 2022-07-01\nThis release adds new functionality around expanding and collapsing related entities in Network Graph related components. We've moved the @senzing/sdk-graph-components to the scope of this package for easier maintenance and installation(now you just need this package instead of two). We're also adding the Why Not component that can be embedded between two or more entities to generate a report to show why two entities/records did not resolve.\nAdded\n\nThe SzWhyEntitiesComparisonComponent added for doing WHY comparison between entities.

with\nSenzing,\nplease start with\nSenzing Quick Start guides.\nYou are in the\nSenzing Garage\nwhere projects are \"tinkered\" on.\nAlthough this GitHub repository may help you understand an approach to using Senzing,\nit's not considered to be \"production ready\" and is not considered to be part of the Senzing product.\nHeck, it may not even be appropriate for your application of Senzing!\nOverview\nThis project is for the Senzing® SDK components that can be used in other projects. There are two flavors that the components come in. The @senzing/sdk-components-ng package which is based around the Angular 13.x.x framework, and the @senzing/sdk-components-web package which is framework agnostic and based around the Web Components standard. The usage for both packages is noted in the documentation examples.\nFor information on the Web Components version see the sdk-components-web guide. \n\n\n\n\nDependencies\nFor building from Source:\n\nNode/NPM.\nAngular CLI\nTypeScript\n\nPlease see the installation instructions for each of these for how to install and setup each one properly.\nInstallation\nShortcuts\nIf you're developing on Windows or macOS, you can make use of the Senzing app\nto help populate an entity repository to test with.  It also gives you an easy way to load and browse data\noutside of the Senzing POC API Server.  See the instructions\nfor using the Senzing App Integration Scripts\nto start the Senzing REST API Server using your existing projects in the Senzing app.\nREST API Server\nThese components require an implementation of the Senzing REST API\nto function.  You can use the Senzing REST API Server as a default\nimplementation in Java.  Follow the instructions to check out and\nbuild the Senzing POC API Server from source or download a pre-built\nversion when available.\nSDK Components\nOpen a terminal window to the location of your project and type:\nng add @angular/material\nng add @senzing/sdk-components-ng\nThe components package, along with any missing dependencies will be added to your project. \nAlternatively you can install the components and dependencies without the angular-cli via npm individually:\nnpm i @angular/material @angular/cdk @senzing/sdk-components-ng --save\nPlease take note that all the same interfaces, and services from the @senzing/rest-api-client-ng package will also be available for convenience.\nUsage\nJust add the import statement for the particular component, service, or model that you want to use.\nExample :import {\n  SzEntitySearchParams,\n  SzAttributeSearchResult\n} from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';Quick Start\n1) Start up an instance of the Senzing POC API Server\nif not currently running.\nSee the README.md for instructions on how\nto start the Senzing REST API Server on the command line or with Docker.\n2) Add the SenzingSDKModule to your angular app's app.module.ts\nExample :import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { SenzingSdkModule } from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    SenzingSdkModule.forRoot()\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }3) Check that components can be rendered correctly. Add the following to your app.component.html (or any template) and verify the result:\nExample :The result should be a powered by logo like the following:\n\nIf not then double check that step 2 is correct, and that you remembered to include the\nimport statement as well.\n4) Check that components can communicate with rest api gateway sucessfully. Add the following to your app.component.html(or any template):\nExample :The result should be a list of service configuration parameters and values.\n5) Load the engine with data to resolve. The easiest way to do this currently is to load a CSV using the\nSenzing app.  This can also be done through the\nSenzing REST API using the Senzing POC API Server.\n6) Verify that the components are working properly. The easiest way to do this is to is to just implement a search box, and a result list. Copy the following to your app.component.html file\nExample :\nnow in your controller class (app.component.ts) add the onSearchResults and onSearchResultClick methods we just referenced above:\nExample :import { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport {\n  SzEntitySearchParams,\n  SzAttributeSearchResult\n} from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  title = 'senzing-sdk-consumer';\n  public currentSearchResults: SzAttributeSearchResult[];\n  public currentlySelectedEntityId: number;\n  public currentSearchParameters: SzEntitySearchParams;\n\n  onSearchResults(evt: SzAttributeSearchResult[]) {\n    console.log('@senzing/sz-search-results: ', evt);\n    // store on current scope\n    this.currentSearchResults = evt;\n    // results module is bound to this property\n  }\n\n  public onSearchResultClick(entityData: SzAttributeSearchResult) {\n    console.log('@senzing/sz-search-results-click: ', entityData);\n\n    if (entityData && entityData.entityId > 0) {\n      this.currentlySelectedEntityId = entityData.entityId;\n    }\n  }\n}Now, start up your standard Angular dev server (or maybe just restart for fun) via ng serve\nand you should be greeted by a page like with a search box. And search results list right below it.\n\nAnd that's it! At least for the quickstart. There are a ton more options for running the rest server, interacting with the components and services.\nConfiguration & Parameters\nThe SenzingSDKModule accepts a factory method that returns an instance of the\nSzRestConfiguration class. By adding a factory like the following to the forRoot method, you can change services configuration to point to non-default values.\nThe following tells any components to turn on CORS functionality and make all api requests to localhost port 8080 (i.e.: http://localhost:8080/).\nExample :import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { SenzingSdkModule, SzRestConfiguration } from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n// create exportable factory  \n// for AOT compilation\nexport function SzRestConfigurationFactory() {\n  return new SzRestConfiguration({\n    basePath: 'http://localhost:8080',\n    withCredentials: true\n  });\n}\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    SenzingSdkModule.forRoot( SzRestConfigurationFactory )\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Parameters\nSee online documentation for a complete list of configuration parameters that can control the connection behavior of the sdk components.\nDocumentation\nInstallation contains a statically generated API and component references. They can be found in\nnode_modules/@senzing/sdk-components-ng/docs or Online here.\nExamples\nWhen you check out the source for this repository there is a directory of Angular project examples. Please see the Examples Readme for more information on how these work.\nTroubleshooting\nOccasionally something does go wrong (I know, I know right?). Here are some common things we run in to:\n\n  \n    \n      Problem\n      Solution\n      Explanation\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      messages like GET http://attribute-types/ net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED are\n      showing up in the developer console\n      \n        Set the api configuration to the address and port your rest server is running at by\n        passing in an instance of SzRestConfiguration to the SenzingSdkModule.forRoot method.\n        \n        Double check and make sure you can connect to your rest server via\n        curl -i http://localhost:8080/heartbeat\n      \n      \n        The api is trying to hit the rest server without an appropriate basepath or the hostname.\n      \n    \n    \n      npm run start throws weird \"No App Module\" error\n      recompile the npm package. \n      npm run build\n      For whatever reason sometimes the builder misses compiling packages. open up dist/@senzing/sdk-components/public_api.d.ts and check to make sure all the packages being referenced actually got compiled.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nExample :                             Apache License\n                       Version 2.0, January 2004\n                    http://www.apache.org/licenses/   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\nDefinitions.\n\"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,\nand distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.\n\"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by\nthe copyright owner that is granting the License.\n\"Legal Entity\" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all\nother entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common\ncontrol with that entity.

pages and web apps. Custom components and widgets built on the Web Component standards, will work across modern browsers, and can be used with any JavaScript library or framework that work with HTML.\nFor more information on the subject see the following sites:\n\nWebComponents.org\nWeb Components | MDN\nBuilding Components | Web Fundamentals | Google Developers\n\nWeb Components Vs. Angular\n\nTag Attributes are kabob-case\nTag names are prefixed with sz-wc\nDOM events are camel-case\nDOM properties are camel-case\n\nAll Web Component tag names are prefixed with sz-wc. This is to prevent tag namespace collision/pollution. When browsing any of the online documentation examples, and you see a tag start with sz-, just remember if you are using the @senzing/sdk-components-web package your tag name should start with sz-wc instead.\nThe other main difference between the two implementations is that if using angular the attributes are Camel Case, and if using web components the attributes are kabob case. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Special_case_styles\nWhen accessing a method or setter through the DOM on a web component programatically however, you access the setter/method in camel case ie:\nExample :\n\n\n    // hide graph filter control programatically\n    document.querySelector('sz-wc-standalone-graph').showFiltersControl = false;\nGetting Started\nGetting set up to work with the Senzing SDK Components can be done in as little as 10 minutes if you already have an Senzing REST API Server installation running. \nSee the Quick Start Guide for instructions.\nCompatibility\nAny web page or application that can render web component tags can be enabled by adding the @senzing/sdk-components-web package to it's dependencies. The basic requirement is that the application hosting the tags can parse javascript and supports rendering custom component tags. All modern web browsers, some mobile browsers, and any native applications that support embedded web views should be able to render these components.\nAdd the css file to your document:\nExample :Add the javascript to your document:\nExample :\n  Note*\n  You may have to change the paths pointing to each of these files depending on how your application is layed out.

We could add things like api request proxy authentication, ssl, react app, electron shell etc. \nThis guide is meant purely to get you from zero to working example as quickly as possible.\nPreparation\nYou should set up a working directory, and initialize it.\nExample :mkdir wc-example-spa && cd wc-example-spa\ngit init\nnpm init -yIf you get an error on git --version you don't have git installed. If you get an error on npm -v you do not have node installed. While you can run the components without either of these tools it's beyond the purposes of illustrating how to get things up and running quickly  ;)\n\nDownload NodeJS\nDownload Git\n\nInstallation\nExample :npm install @senzing/sdk-components-web --saveCreate an HTML document\nSo you can either create a html document from scratch or just grab one from the node_modules/@senzing/sdk-components-web/examples directory. For the sake of brevity I'm going to illustrate the latter option. Open up a terminal to your working project directory and type:\nExample :cp -r node_modules/\\@senzing/sdk-components-web/examples/* ./This should copy all of the example .html files from the package in to your working directory.\nSet the components to your API Server address\nOpen up the example file and update the sz-wc-configuration tag, or add the following to the top of the document  tag contents:\nExample :This will tell the components to redirect all api server calls to localhost:8080. The next step will set up a redirect to forward any unresolved requests to your api server hostname.\nServe your HTML\nGo to your terminal and execute the following command. Replace the http://americium.local:8250 part with the address to your API Rest Server address.\nExample :npx http-server --proxy http://americium.local:8250By default http-server will run on localhost:8080, and any resources that it can't find will be redirected to the address specified in the --proxy parameter.\nNow open up localhost:8080 and browse to the file/example being worked on.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/web-components/examples.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/web-components/examples.html","title":"additional-page - Examples","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are Web Components ?\nWeb components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps.

Due to tag namespace collision issues all web components are prefixed with sz-wc.\nIf using the sdk-components-ng package the tag is called sz-relationship-network.\nIf using the sdk-components-web package the tag is prefixed with sz-wc-relationship-network.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/themes.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/themes.html","title":"additional-page - Themes","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThemes\nBy default things will come unstyled. It's much easier to add styles than it is to remove them. Component styles are opt-in rather than opt-out.\nThe theming of components is handled via CSS Variables. Essentially you add the css-var key and it's css value to which the selector/property combination applies to your documents body styles like below:\nExample :body {\n        --sz-search-button-submit-padding: 0 30px 0 30px;\n        --sz-search-button-border-radius: 3px;\n        --sz-search-button-clear-font-size: 10px;\n        --sz-search-label-margin: 0 0 10px 4px;\n        --sz-search-input-border-radius: 8px;\n}Pre-Built\nFor a list of precompiled themes and how to use them \nsee the docs for more information.\nCustom\nFor more information about creating a custom theme \nsee the docs for more information.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/themes/pre-built.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/themes/pre-built.html","title":"additional-page - Pre Built","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre Defined\nWe've included some pre-built themes for quick usage to get you up and running. You'll almost certainly want to create your own, or tweak things to match your application's styling as needed. The compiled css files are located in the styles/themes directory in the package being used.\nusing SASS\nif you're using sass(and scss processor can reference node_modules), open up your main scss file(src/styles.scss in default angular layout) and include the following.\nExample :@import '@senzing/sdk-components-ng/styles/themes/senzing.css';using CSS\nthere are several different ways to include a pre-built theme in your project.\nYou could just add the stylesheet path to your main html file and include the css reference in the HEAD of your document.\nExample :for production it is recommended you copy the theme stylesheet you will be using over to a static directory(probably a bad idea to leave node_modules open to the world) and change the above reference to point to it's location. \nAngular projects\nif you're using the sdk components in the scope of an angular project the recommended way is to add the theme file path to your angular.json file for your project.\n\n\nfind the _architect.build.options.styles node in the file, and add the path there. \nExample :\"styles\": [\n  \"src/styles.scss\",\n  \"node_modules/\\\\@senzing/sdk-components-ng/styles/themes/drab.css\"\n],and next time you run or build your angular project it will include the theme file for the sdk components.\n\n  Note*\n  Windows users have to deal with _escaping_ escape charaters when directly accessing npm namespaced paths.\n  (illustrated above) \n\n\n\nThemes\n\n\n\n  \n    Drab\n    location: \n      node_modules/@senzing/sdk-components-ng/styles/themes/drab.css\n      \n  \n  \n    Senzing\n    location: \n      node_modules/@senzing/sdk-components-ng/styles/themes/senzing.css\n      \n  \n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/themes/customizing.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/themes/customizing.html","title":"additional-page - Customizing","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomizing Themes\nsdk-components-ng and sdk-components-web both make use of CSS Variables for styling. This provides a easy way to modify the existing styles, or make entirely new themes just by editing the values in the dom inspector, and saving the overridden values in a simple stylesheet.\nthe following are the currently supported css variables:\nExample :body {\n  --sz-font-family: Arial;\n  --sz-color-matches: #0E2863;\n  --sz-color-possible-match: #2B7169;\n  --sz-color-possibly-related:
