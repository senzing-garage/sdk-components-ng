of an electron app using the sdk components feel free to checkout the latest windows or mac builds from https://senzing.com/senzing-app/\nDependencies\nFor building from Source: \n\nNode/NPM. \nAngular CLI\nTypeScript\nSenzing REST API Sever\n\nPlease see the installation instructions for each of these for how to install and setup each one properly.\nInstallation\nShortcuts\nIf you're developing on Windows or macOS, do yourself a favor and download and install the app. It installs the G2 libs and sets up project config files. It also gives you an easy way to load and browse data outside of the Senzing REST API Sever. You can do it manually too if you need to.\n \nREST API Server\nThese components require the senzing Senzing REST API Sever to function. Follow the instructions to check out and build the Senzing REST API Sever from source or download a pre-built. \nBuild(and run) from Source\ngit@github.com:Senzing/senzing-api-server.git\ncd senzing-api-server\nmvn clean install\njava -jar target/sz-api-server-1.5.0.jar -iniFile %LOCALAPPDATA%/Senzing/Workbench/project_1/g2.ini-->   \n\nSDK Components\nopen a terminal window to the location of your project and type: \nnpm install @senzing/sdk-components-ng --save\nThe components will be added to your node_modules. \nPlease take note that all the same interfaces, and services from the @senzing/rest-api-client-ng package will also be available for convenience.\nUsage\nJust add the import statement for the particular component, service, or model that you want to use. \nimport {\n  SzEntitySearchParams,\n  SzAttributeSearchResult\n} from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';   \nQuick Start\n1) Start up an instance of the rest api server if not currently running.\nyou can start up the REST Server manually by invoking through java, or by making a slight change to the npm script(for convenience).\nthrough java:\njava -jar \"%HOMEPATH%\\www\\senzing-api-server\\target\\sz-api-server-1.5.0.jar\" -iniFile \"%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Senzing\\Workbench\\project_1\\g2.ini\" \nvia npm script: \nedit(or add) the following line in package.json to point to your projects G2.ini path and the REST Server JAR. Then the server can just be started up by runnning npm run start:server.\n\"start:server\": \"java -jar \\\"%HOMEPATH%\\\\www\\\\senzing-api-server\\\\target\\\\sz-api-server-1.5.0.jar\\\" -iniFile \\\"%LOCALAPPDATA%\\\\Senzing\\\\Workbench\\\\project_1\\\\g2.ini\\\"\",   \n2) Add the SenzingSDKModule to your angular app's app.module.ts \nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { SenzingSdkModule } from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    SenzingSdkModule.forRoot()\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }   \n3) Check that components can be rendered correctly. Add the following to your app.component.html(or any template) and verify the result: \nThe result should be a powered by logo like the following:\n\n\nIf not then double check that step 2 is correct, and that you remembered to include the \nimport statement as well.\n \n \n\n4) Check that components can communicate with rest api gateway sucessfully. Add the following to your app.component.html(or any template) : \nThe result should be a list of service configuration parameters and values.\n5) Load the engine with data to resolve. \n   The easiest way to do this currently is to load a CSV using the application. This can also be done through the Senzing REST API.\n6) Verify that the components are working properly. The easiest way to do this is to is to just implement a search box, and a result list. Copy the following to your app.component.html file\n\nnow in your controller class(app.component.ts) add the onSearchResults and onSearchResultClick methods we just referenced above:\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport {\n  SzEntitySearchParams,\n  SzAttributeSearchResult\n} from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  title = 'senzing-sdk-consumer';\n  public currentSearchResults: SzAttributeSearchResult[];\n  public currentlySelectedEntityId: number;\n  public currentSearchParameters: SzEntitySearchParams;\n\n  onSearchResults(evt: SzAttributeSearchResult[]) {\n    console.log('@senzing/sz-search-results: ', evt);\n    // store on current scope\n    this.currentSearchResults = evt;\n    // results module is bound to this property\n  }\n\n  public onSearchResultClick(entityData: SzAttributeSearchResult) {\n    console.log('@senzing/sz-search-results-click: ', entityData);\n\n    if (entityData && entityData.entityId > 0) {\n      this.currentlySelectedEntityId = entityData.entityId;\n    }\n  }\n}Now, start up your standard angular dev server(or maybe just restart for fun) via ng serve\nand you should be greeted by a page like with a search box. And search results list right below it.\n\n\nAnd that's it! at least for the quickstart. There are a ton more options for running the rest server, interacting with the components and services. \n\n   \nConfiguration & Parameters\nThe SenzingSDKModule accepts a factory method that returns an instance of the \nSzRestConfiguration class. By adding a factory like the following to the forRoot method, you can change services configuration to point to non-default values.\nThe following tells any components to turn on CORS functionality and make all api requests to localhost port 2080( http://localhost:2080/ ).\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { SenzingSdkModule, SzRestConfiguration } from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n// create exportable factory  \n// for AOT compilation\nexport function SzRestConfigurationFactory() {\n  return new SzRestConfiguration({\n    basePath: 'http://localhost:2080',\n    withCredentials: true\n  });\n}\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    SenzingSdkModule.forRoot( SzRestConfigurationFactory )\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { } \nParameters\nSee online documentation for a complete list of configuration parameters that can control the connection behavior of the sdk components.\nDocumentation\nInstallation contains a statically generated API and component references. They can be found in\nnode_modules/@senzing/sdk-components-ng/docs or Online here.\nExamples\nWhen you check out the source for this repository there is a directory of Angular project examples. Please see the Examples Readme for more information on how these work.\nTroubleshooting\noccasionally something does go wrong(I know, I know right?). Here are some common things we run in to:\n\n  \n    \n      Problem\n      Solution\n      Explanation\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      messages like GET http://attribute-types/ net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED are \n      showing up in the developer console\n      \n        Set the api configuration to the address and port your rest server is running at by \n        passing in an instance of SzRestConfiguration to the SenzingSdkModule.forRoot method.\n        \n        Double check and make sure you can connect to your rest server via \n        curl -i http://localhost:2080/heartbeat\n      \n      \n        The api is trying to hit the rest server without an appropriate basepath or the hostname.\n      \n    \n    \n      npm run start throws weird \"No App Module\" error\n      recompile the npm package. \n      npm run build\n      For whatever reason sometimes the builder misses compiling packages. open up dist/@senzing/sdk-components/public_api.d.ts and check to make sure all the packages being referenced actually got compiled.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\n                             Apache License\n                       Version 2.0, January 2004\n                    http://www.apache.org/licenses/   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\nDefinitions.\n\"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,\nand distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.\n\"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by\nthe copyright owner that is granting the License.\n\"Legal Entity\" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all\nother entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common\ncontrol with that entity.

It's much easier to add styles than it is to remove them. Component styles are opt-in rather than opt-out.\nThe theming of components is handled via CSS Variables. Essentially you add the css-var key and it's css value to which the selector/property combination applies to your documents body styles like below:\nbody {\n        --sz-search-button-submit-padding: 0 30px 0 30px;\n        --sz-search-button-border-radius: 3px;\n        --sz-search-button-clear-font-size: 10px;\n        --sz-search-label-margin: 0 0 10px 4px;\n        --sz-search-input-border-radius: 8px;\n}Pre-Built\nFor a list of precompiled themes and how to use them \nsee the docs for more information.\nCustom\nFor more information about creating a custom theme \nsee the docs for more information.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/themes/pre-built.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/themes/pre-built.html","title":"additional-page - Pre Built","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre Defined\nWe've included some pre-built themes for quick usage to get you up and running. You'll almost certainly want to create your own, or tweak things to match your application's styling as needed. The compiled css files are located in the styles/themes directory in the package being used.\nusing SASS\nif you're using sass(and scss processor can reference node_modules), open up your main scss file(src/styles.scss in default angular layout) and include the following.\n@import '@senzing/sdk-components-ng/styles/themes/senzing.css';using CSS\nthere are several different ways to include a pre-built theme in your project.\nYou could just add the stylesheet path to your main html file and include the css reference in the HEAD of your document.\nfor production it is recommended you copy the theme stylesheet you will be using over to a static directory(probably a bad idea to leave node_modules open to the world) and change the above reference to point to it's location. \nAngular projects\nif you're using the sdk components in the scope of an angular project the recommended way is to add the theme file path to your angular.json file for your project.\n\n\nfind the _architect.build.options.styles node in the file, and add the path there. \n\"styles\": [\n  \"src/styles.scss\",\n  \"node_modules/\\\\@senzing/sdk-components-ng/styles/themes/drab.css\"\n],and next time you run or build your angular project it will include the theme file for the sdk components.\n\n  Note*\n  Windows users have to deal with _escaping_ escape charaters when directly accessing npm namespaced paths.\n  (illustrated above) \n\n\n\nThemes\n\n\n\n  \n    Drab\n    location: \n      node_modules/@senzing/sdk-components-ng/styles/themes/drab.css\n      \n  \n  \n    Senzing\n    location: \n      node_modules/@senzing/sdk-components-ng/styles/themes/senzing.css\n      \n  \n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/themes/customizing.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/themes/customizing.html","title":"additional-page - Customizing","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomizing Themes\nsdk-components-ng and sdk-components-web both make use of CSS Variables for styling. This provides a easy way to modify the existing styles, or make entirely new themes just by editing the values in the dom inspector, and saving the overridden values in a simple stylesheet.\nthe
