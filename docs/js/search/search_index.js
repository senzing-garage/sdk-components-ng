window to the location of your project and typenpm install @senzing/service-rest-http --save\nComponents\nopen a terminal window to the location of your project and typenpm install @senzing/sdk-components-ng --save\n  \nDependencies\nthese components are dependent on a rest api gateway to forward requests from the \nweb application to the g2 instance and back. \nNode should install this for you when you install this package. If it doesn't, or \nyou just want to look through it's documentation you can find it Here.\n  \nQuick Start\nAfter installation you will need to do a few more things.\n1) Start up an instance of the @senzing/service-rest-http by running the following \n   from the application root. \njava -jar node_modules/@senzing/service-rest-http/http.jar   \n2) Add the SenzingSDKModule to your angular app's app.module.ts \nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { SenzingSdkModule, SzRestConfiguration } from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    SenzingSdkModule\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }   \n3) Check that components can be rendered correctly. Add the following to your app.component.html(or any template) and verify the result: \nThe result should be a powered by logo like the following:\n\n\npowered by\n\n    \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n    \n\n\n\nIf not then double check that step 2 is correct, and that you remembered to include the \nimport statement as well.\n \n \n\n4) Check that components can communicate with rest api gateway sucessfully. Add the following to your app.component.html(or any template) : \nThe result should be a list of service configuration parameters and values.\n5) Load the engine with data to resolve. \n   The sdk ships with some example data that can be loaded in to the engine. An example of how to do that  is below:\n   5.1) TODO\n6) Verify that the components are working properly. The easiest way to do this is to is to just implement a search box, and a result list. Copy the following to your app.component.html file\n\nnow in your controller class(app.component.ts) add the onSearchResults and onSearchResultClick methods we just referenced above:\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { SzSearchResults, SzSearchResultEntityData, SzEntitySearchParams } from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  title = 'senzing-sdk-consumer';\n  public currentSearchResults: SzSearchResults;\n  public currentlySelectedEntityId = 4068;\n  public currentSearchParameters: SzEntitySearchParams;\n\n  onSearchResults(evt: SzSearchResults) {\n    console.log('@senzing/sz-search-results: ', evt);\n    // store on current scope\n    this.currentSearchResults = evt;\n    // results module is bound to this property\n  }\n\n  public onSearchResultClick(entityData: SzSearchResultEntityData) {\n    console.log('@senzing/sz-search-results-click: ', entityData);\n\n    if (entityData && entityData.entityId > 0) {\n      this.currentlySelectedEntityId = entityData.entityId;\n    }\n  }\n}   \nConfiguration & Parameters\nConfiguration\nThe SenzingSDKModule accepts a factory method or a object literal that conforms to the \nproperties found in the SzRestConfiguration class. By adding a factory like the following to the constructor method, you can change services configuration to point to non-default values.\nThe following tells any components to make api requests to http://localhost:22080/api/\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { SenzingSdkModule, SzRestConfiguration } from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    SenzingSdkModule.forRoot(() => {\n      return new SzRestConfiguration({\n        basePath: \"http://localhost:22080/api/\",\n        withCredentials: false\n      })\n    })\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { } \nParameters\n  \n      \n              \n                  \n                      Properties\n                  \n              \n              \n                  \n                      \n                          \n                                  Optional\n                              accessToken\n                          \n                          \n                                  Optional\n                              apiKeys\n                          \n                          \n                                  Optional\n                              basePath\n                          \n                          \n                                  Optional\n                              hostName\n                          \n                          \n                                  Optional\n                              password\n                          \n                          \n                                  Optional\n                              portNum\n                          \n                          \n                                  Optional\n                              username\n                          \n                          \n                                  Optional\n                              withCredentials\n                          \n                      \n                  \n              \n              \n                  \n                      Methods\n                  \n              \n              \n                  \n                      \n                          \n                                  Public\n                              isJsonMime\n                          \n                          \n                                  Public\n                              selectHeaderAccept\n                          \n                          \n                                  Public\n                              selectHeaderContentType\n                          \n                      \n                  \n              \n      \n  \n\n\nDocumentation\nInstallation contains a statically generated API and component references.

If you change the port number or are hosting the http server on a machine different from the machine you are following this walkthrough on please replace http://localhost:22080 with the relevant hostname and port number.\nLoad in some data\nLets load in some stub data for the purposes of demonstrating that our rest service is operating in the expected manner. Gotta have something to search through right? \nlets fire up another console window and load in some data.\ncd node_modules/@senzing/service-http-rest\nnode loader.js --file=./demo-data/1.csvSDK Components\nThe SDK components have to know the network address information of where the HTTP services are running to communicate. There are a number of ways to do this:\n  1) At run time, injected in to the sdkModule's constructor.\n  2) At run time, by calling the sz-configuration component with the properties as attributes.\n  3) Before run time, by modifying the SDK Service's api.configuration.json file.\n  4) Before run time, by using a reverse proxy. \n1)\nOpen up your application's app.module.ts file and add the SDK imports(SenzingSdkModule, and SzRestConfiguration)\nimport { SenzingSdkModule, SzRestConfiguration } from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';Now add the SenzingSdkModule to your applications imports. You can pass in the API configuration parameters inline(shown below) or via any factory method that constructs a SzRestConfiguration object. Your application's NgModule declaration should look something like this below:\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    SenzingSdkModule.forRoot(() => {\n      return new SzRestConfiguration({\n        basePath: \"/api/\",        \n        withCredentials: false\n      })\n    })\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\n2)\nthe senzing sdk can be configured at run time to point to the location of where the rest service is running this can be done through the configuration tag:\n4) Reverse Proxy (for development)\nFor the easiest set up possible you may want to use angular-cli's built in reverse proxy support. This is not recommended for production deployment. By using the reverse proxy, you can temporarily avoid any security issues that will be present in production implementations. To do this type the following in a terminal window from your angular project's root:\necho '{\"api\": {\"target\": \"http://localhost:22080/workbench/\", \"secure\": false }}' > proxy.conf.jsonnow add(or just update if already present) the following to your npm package.json start script:\n\"start\":\"ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json\"\nNow anytime you serve the angular application via npm start it will start up the angular development server with a built-in reverse proxy from http://localhost:4200/api/**/* -> http://localhost:22080/workbench/*\nAdd SDK Module to application\nopen up your app's entry point module declaration, this is usually located in src/app/app.module.ts\nand add the following to it's imports. If you've already done this in the previous step, or are using the web component(s) feel free to skip ahead to the html markup step.\nimport { SenzingSdkModule } from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';now add the SenzingSdkModule to the components imports property:\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    SenzingSdkModule\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})we should edit our app's template to pull in some SDK components. lets add the \"powered by senzing\" component just to make sure our angular app can pull in and render components from the sdk first.\nOpen up the app.component.html and replace the content with the following:\n\n  \n  \nnow lets start up the angular dev server\nng serveyou should see a white background with the senzing logo in the top center of the page and a small table of service configuration and datasource properties(pictured below). If you do not then something is wrong. Re-read the steps above and double check that you didn't miss anything.\nUsage\nplease see api documentation for specific language implementation examples and usage. \n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/themes.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/themes.html","title":"additional-page - Themes","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThemes\nyup. we support themes. fffff-f-f-fff-f-faaaancy.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/themes/pre-built.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/themes/pre-built.html","title":"additional-page - Pre Built","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre Defined\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/themes/customizing.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/themes/customizing.html","title":"additional-page - Customizing","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomizing Themes\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
