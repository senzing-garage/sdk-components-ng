dynamically change the global\nvalues that are passed throughout all components for API connection requests.\nThis service is provided for advanced usage where the connection parameters have to\nchange dynamically through the application lifecycle(ie changing request namespace from 'http://api.mydomain.com' to 'http://api.mydomain.com/SUBSECTION').\nIf your application just needs its values initialized that should be done by\npassing in a config factory to the SenzingSdkModule method.\nthis.apiconf.basePath = 'http://apis.mydomain.com/';this.apiconf.parametersChanged.subscribe( (params) => { console.log('api connection params changed.', params); })\n            \n\n\n\n            \n    Index\n    \n        \n                \n                    \n

the corresponding value through this service.\nrepresentational state is published and responded to through this class.\nit is up to the end consumer what to do with this data. it is not stored

We've moved the @senzing/sdk-graph-components to the scope of this package for easier maintenance and installation(now you just need this package instead of two). We're also adding the Why Not component that can be embedded between two or more entities to generate a report to show why two entities/records did not resolve.\nAdded\n\nThe SzWhyEntitiesComparisonComponent added for doing WHY comparison between entities. Adds the ability to run \"Why Not\" Reports from within the context of the search results and graph. \nThe following input parameters added to SzSearchResultsComponent:\nshowWhyComparisonButton

by SzStandaloneGraphComponent and SzEntityDetailGraphComponent.\ncanRemoveNode(entityId: SzEntityIdentifier) returns boolean if an entity on canvas can be removed(root nodes, and primary query nodes cannot).\ncanExpandNode(entityId: SzEntityIdentifier) returns boolean if a node has hidden related entities that can be shown on canvas.\nremoveNode(entityId: SzEntityIdentifier) removes a single node and any directly related nodes \ncollapseNode(entityId: SzEntityIdentifier) hide all visible(expanded) entities related to a specific entity that are themselves not related to any other visible entities.\nexpandNode(entityId: SzEntityIdentifier) show any entities that are related to a specific entity that are currently not on the canvas.\n\n\nThe following event emitters added to SzGraphComponent\nrelationshipContextMenuClick is emitted when a user right clicks on relationship lines/labels in the embedded graph component. \nrelationshipClick is emitted when a user clicks on relationship lines/labels in the embedded graph component.\n\n\nThe following methods added to SzEntityDetailComponent\nisGraphEntityRemovable(entityId: SzEntityIdentifier) can a specific entity node be removed from canvas.\nshowGraphEntityRelationships(entityId: SzEntityIdentifier) show any entities that are related to a specific entity that are currently not on the canvas.\nhideGraphEntityRelationships(entityId: SzEntityIdentifier) hide all visible(expanded) entities related to a specific entity that are themselves not related to any other visible entities.\nhideGraphEntity(entityId: SzEntityIdentifier) remove single node and any directly related nodes that are only related to the entity specified.\n\n\nSzRelationshipNetworkComponent moved from @senzing/sdk-graph-components\nSzRelationshipNetworkInputComponent moved from @senzing/sdk-graph-components\nSzRelationshipNetworkLookupComponent moved from @senzing/sdk-graph-components\nSzRelationshipPathComponent moved from @senzing/sdk-graph-components\nThe following methods added to SzRelationshipNetworkComponent\ncanExpandNode does a node have hidden related nodes that can be displayed.\nexpandNode show all hidden nodes related to the node specified.\ncanRemoveNode can a node be removed.\nremoveNode removes a single node, all it's related and/or both.\ncenter centers the graph viewport.\naddExistingNodeData used for data merge/transform operation.\naddLinksToNodeData used for data merge/transform operation.\nasEntityNetworkData gets the state of graph nodes/links as EntityNetworkData\nonLinkClick when a user clicks on a relationship link line or label.\nonLinkDblClick when a user double clicks on a relationship link line or label.\nonLinkContextClick when a user right clicks on a relationship link line or label.\ngetNodeByIdQuery returns a D3.Selection of the node that matches the entity id provided.\ngetNodesByIdQuery

emitted with the result of asEntityNetworkData()\nonShowRelatedEntities event emitted when the user expands or collapses a entity nodes related nodes.\nonHideRelatedEntities event emitted when the user expands or collapses a entity nodes related nodes.\n\n\nMajor refactoring around the draw mechanism inside SzRelationshipNetworkComponent.addSvg() method reorganized or rewritten. The following subroutines added:\ngetNodeVisibilityClass returns a array with the string of sz-node-state-hidden if node is supposed to be hidden. (used for css queries)\nsetNodePositionsAsCircle takes a selection of entity nodes and places their X,Y positions on an arc path(circle) around a central point.\napplyPositionToNodes takes the X/Y values set on a node's data property and converts them to CSS transform properties\nupdateLinksForNodes when a node(s) position has changed this sub is called to keep the end of the link path attached to the node being moved\nattachEventListenersToNodes attach internal handlers for things like click, drag, mouseover events to a selection of nodes so handlers are called.\nstopEventListenersForNodes remove event handers for a selection of nodes\nattachEventListenersToLinks attach internal handlers for things like click, drag, mouseover events to a selection of nodes so handlers are called.\npolarToCartesian dependency for drawing concentric rings\ndescribeArc dependency for drawing concentric rings\ncircleCoord dependency for drawing concentric rings\ngetRingSchemaForNodes gets a object describing a ring based drawing layout for nodes\ndrawNodesInRings takes a collection of entities and lays them out in increasing diameter along rings around an X and Y origin.\ndrawLinks draws the links between entity nodes on svg canvas\ndrawNodes draws the entity nodes on svg canvas\nonExpandCollapseClick event handler for when a node's expand or collapsed glyph is clicked on.\n\n\nSzRelationshipNetworkComponent.onNodeContextClick added the following to the contextMenuClick event emitter so the context menu could be positioned correctly.\neventPageX the x position on the page non-relative that the event occurred at.\neventPageY the y position on the page non-relative that the event occurred at.\n\n\nSzRelationshipNetworkComponent.contextMenuClick\neventPageX the x position on the page non-relative that the event occurred at.\neventPageY the y position on the page non-relative that the event occurred at.\n\n\n\nRemoved\n\nThe following methods have been removed from SzRelationshipNetworkComponent\nonSimulationCycle gravity simulation has been removed in favor or concentric ring algorithm.\nunlockForcePosition gravity simulation has been removed in favor or concentric ring algorithm.\nlockForcePosition gravity simulation has been removed in favor or concentric ring algorithm.\nfade used to highlight directly related  nodes by changing the opacity of all unrelated nodes\nlinkfade used to highlight directly related  nodes by changing the opacity of all unrelated nodes\nonNodeDragEnded no longer needed\n\n\n\nModified\n\n_graphIds property on SzGraphComponent type changed from number[] to SzEntityIdentifier[]\ngraphIds property getter and setter on SzGraphComponent type changed from number[] to SzEntityIdentifier[]\nreload method in SzGraphComponent parameter type changed to string | number | SzEntityIdentifier | SzEntityIdentifier[]\nMajor refactoring around the draw mechanism inside SzRelationshipNetworkComponent. Almost all of the routiines in addSvg method reorganized or rewritten.

(defaults to true)\nshowMatchKeyFilters property added to sz-graph-filter tag. specifying a value of false will hide the Filter By Match Key list of checkboxes. (defaults to true)\nSzWhyEntityComponent component for displaying results from the api server's respective why endpoints(/entities/{entityId}/why).\nparseSzIdentifier function added to src/lib/common/utils.ts\nnonTextTrim function added to src/lib/common/utils.ts\nSzWhySelectionMode \nshowWhyFunction input attribute added to SzEntityDetailComponent. Turns on the availability of \"Why\" related functions(Why button under icon, why buttons in the records section) in the entity detail component.\nwhySelectionMode input attribute added to SzEntityDetailComponent. Turns on the availability of \"Why\" related functions(Why button under icon, why buttons in the records section) in the entity detail component. values are NONE|SINGLE|MULTI\nopenWhyComparisonModalOnClick input attribute added to SzEntityDetailComponent. setting to false will mean that the integrator will be responsible for responding to \"Why\" events(recordsWhyButtonClick,headerWhyButtonClick), the component will no longer display a modal on click by default. \nThe following getters/setters, and methods to SzEntityDetailComponent\nshowRecordWhyUtilities - explicitly hide or show the why buttons on individual records.\nshowEntityWhyFunction - explicitly hide or show the why button under the icon.\nonCompareRecordsForWhy() - is what is called when a recordsWhyButtonClick event is invoked.\nonHeaderWhyButtonClick() - is what is called when a headerWhyButtonClick event is invoked.\n\n\nThe following event emitters to SzEntityDetailComponent\nrecordsWhyButtonClick - is emitted when a user clicks a why button from within the context of a record.\nheaderWhyButtonClick - is emitted when a user clicks a why button underneath the icon in the header.\n\n\nThe graph filters found in the SzStandaloneGraphComponent can now show a tag cloud of Match Key Tokens. If setting the showMatchKeyTokenFilters=\"true\" you should also set the showMatchKeyFilters]=\"false\" since the two options are exclusive and will interfere with proper function of the other.\n\nRemoved\n\nthe following methods removed SzAdminService\naddEntityClasses()\naddEntityTypes()\naddEntityTypesForClass()\ngetCurrentConfig()\ngetDefaultConfig()\ngetEntityClass()\ngetEntityType()\ngetEntityTypeByClass()\nlistEntityClasses()\nlistEntityTypes()\nlistEntityTypesByClass()\n\n\nthe following parameters removed from SzAdminService.loadBulkRecords()\nentityType\nmapEntityTypes\nmapEntityType\n\n\nthe following properties removed from SzBulkDataService\n_entityTypes\nentityTypeMap\nentityTypes\n\n\nthe following event emitters from SzBulkDataService\nonEntityTypesChange\nonEntityTypeMapChange\n\n\nthe following methods removed from SzBulkDataService\nupdateEntityTypes()\ngetEntityTypeMapFromAnalysis()\nchangeEntityTypeName()\ncreateEntityTypes()\n\n\nthe following parameters removed from SzBulkDataService.load()\nentityTypeMap\n\n\nSzEntityTypesService\nSzSearchResultEntityData.matchScore property\n\n[3.0.0] - 2021-12-17\nModified\n\nAngular Framework Updated to version 13. As of 3.0.0 release this package now requires @angular@~13.0.0 to compile and run. Updating to angular 13 resolves major dependency compatibility issues so we can apply the latest security patches to the library.

\n\n@senzing/sdk-components-ng\nOverview\nThis project is for the Senzing® SDK components that can be used in other projects. There are two flavors that the components come in. The @senzing/sdk-components-ng package which is based around the Angular 13.x.x framework, and the @senzing/sdk-components-web package which is framework agnostic and based around the Web Components standard. The usage for both packages is noted in the documentation examples.\nFor information on the Web Components version see the sdk-components-web guide. \n\n\n\n\nDependencies\nFor building from Source:\n\nNode/NPM.\nAngular CLI\nTypeScript\n\nPlease see the installation instructions for each of these for how to install and setup each one properly.\nInstallation\nShortcuts\nIf you're developing on Windows or macOS, you can make use of the Senzing app\nto help populate an entity repository to test with.  It also gives you an easy way to load and browse data\noutside of the Senzing REST API Sever.  See the instructions\nfor using the Senzing App Integration Scripts\nto start the Senzing REST API Server using your existing projects in the Senzing app.\nREST API Server\nThese components require an implementation of the Senzing REST API\nto function.  You can use the Senzing REST API Server as a default\nimplementation in Java.  Follow the instructions to check out and\nbuild the Senzing REST API Sever from source or download a pre-built\nversion when available.\nSDK Components\nOpen a terminal window to the location of your project and type:\nng add @angular/material\nng add @senzing/sdk-components-ng\nThe components package, along with any missing dependencies will be added to your project. \nAlternatively you can install the components and dependencies without the angular-cli via npm individually:\nnpm i @angular/material @angular/cdk @senzing/sdk-components-ng --save\nPlease take note that all the same interfaces, and services from the @senzing/rest-api-client-ng package will also be available for convenience.\nUsage\nJust add the import statement for the particular component, service, or model that you want to use.\nimport {\n  SzEntitySearchParams,\n  SzAttributeSearchResult\n} from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';Quick Start\n1) Start up an instance of the Senzing REST API Server\nif not currently running.\nSee the README.md for instructions on how\nto start the Senzing REST API Server on the command line or with Docker.\n2) Add the SenzingSDKModule to your angular app's app.module.ts\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { SenzingSdkModule } from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    SenzingSdkModule.forRoot()\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }3) Check that components can be rendered correctly. Add the following to your app.component.html (or any template) and verify the result:\nThe result should be a powered by logo like the following:\n\nIf not then double check that step 2 is correct, and that you remembered to include the\nimport statement as well.\n4) Check that components can communicate with rest api gateway sucessfully. Add the following to your app.component.html(or any template):\nThe result should be a list of service configuration parameters and values.\n5) Load the engine with data to resolve. The easiest way to do this currently is to load a CSV using the\nSenzing app.  This can also be done through the\nSenzing REST API using the Senzing REST API Server.\n6) Verify that the components are working properly. The easiest way to do this is to is to just implement a search box, and a result list. Copy the following to your app.component.html file\n\nnow in your controller class (app.component.ts) add the onSearchResults and onSearchResultClick methods we just referenced above:\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport {\n  SzEntitySearchParams,\n  SzAttributeSearchResult\n} from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  title = 'senzing-sdk-consumer';\n  public currentSearchResults: SzAttributeSearchResult[];\n  public currentlySelectedEntityId: number;\n  public currentSearchParameters: SzEntitySearchParams;\n\n  onSearchResults(evt: SzAttributeSearchResult[]) {\n    console.log('@senzing/sz-search-results: ', evt);\n    // store on current scope\n    this.currentSearchResults = evt;\n    // results module is bound to this property\n  }\n\n  public onSearchResultClick(entityData: SzAttributeSearchResult) {\n    console.log('@senzing/sz-search-results-click: ', entityData);\n\n    if (entityData && entityData.entityId > 0) {\n      this.currentlySelectedEntityId = entityData.entityId;\n    }\n  }\n}Now, start up your standard Angular dev server (or maybe just restart for fun) via ng serve\nand you should be greeted by a page like with a search box. And search results list right below it.\n\nAnd that's it! At least for the quickstart. There are a ton more options for running the rest server, interacting with the components and services.\nConfiguration & Parameters\nThe SenzingSDKModule accepts a factory method that returns an instance of the\nSzRestConfiguration class. By adding a factory like the following to the forRoot method, you can change services configuration to point to non-default values.\nThe following tells any components to turn on CORS functionality and make all api requests to localhost port 8080 (i.e.: http://localhost:8080/).\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { SenzingSdkModule, SzRestConfiguration } from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n// create exportable factory  \n// for AOT compilation\nexport function SzRestConfigurationFactory() {\n  return new SzRestConfiguration({\n    basePath: 'http://localhost:8080',\n    withCredentials: true\n  });\n}\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    SenzingSdkModule.forRoot( SzRestConfigurationFactory )\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Parameters\nSee online documentation for a complete list of configuration parameters that can control the connection behavior of the sdk components.\nDocumentation\nInstallation contains a statically generated API and component references. They can be found in\nnode_modules/@senzing/sdk-components-ng/docs or Online here.\nExamples\nWhen you check out the source for this repository there is a directory of Angular project examples. Please see the Examples Readme for more information on how these work.\nTroubleshooting\nOccasionally something does go wrong (I know, I know right?). Here are some common things we run in to:\n\n  \n    \n      Problem\n      Solution\n      Explanation\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      messages like GET http://attribute-types/ net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED are\n      showing up in the developer console\n      \n        Set the api configuration to the address and port your rest server is running at by\n        passing in an instance of SzRestConfiguration to the SenzingSdkModule.forRoot method.\n        \n        Double check and make sure you can connect to your rest server via\n        curl -i http://localhost:8080/heartbeat\n      \n      \n        The api is trying to hit the rest server without an appropriate basepath or the hostname.\n      \n    \n    \n      npm run start throws weird \"No App Module\" error\n      recompile the npm package. \n      npm run build\n      For whatever reason sometimes the builder misses compiling packages. open up dist/@senzing/sdk-components/public_api.d.ts and check to make sure all the packages being referenced actually got compiled.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\n                             Apache License\n                       Version 2.0, January 2004\n                    http://www.apache.org/licenses/   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\nDefinitions.\n\"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,\nand distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.\n\"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by\nthe copyright owner that is granting the License.\n\"Legal Entity\" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all\nother entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common\ncontrol with that entity.

Custom components and widgets built on the Web Component standards, will work across modern browsers, and can be used with any JavaScript library or framework that work with HTML.\nFor more information on the subject see the following sites:\n\nWebComponents.org\nWeb Components | MDN\nBuilding Components | Web Fundamentals | Google Developers\n\nWeb Components Vs. Angular\n\nTag Attributes are kabob-case\nTag names are prefixed with sz-wc\nDOM events are camel-case\nDOM properties are camel-case\n\nAll Web Component tag names are prefixed with sz-wc. This is to prevent tag namespace collision/pollution. When browsing any of the online documentation examples, and you see a tag start with sz-, just remember if you are using the @senzing/sdk-components-web package your tag name should start with sz-wc instead.\nThe other main difference between the two implementations is that if using angular the attributes are Camel Case, and if using web components the attributes are kabob case. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Special_case_styles\nWhen accessing a method or setter through the DOM on a web component programatically however, you access the setter/method in camel case ie:\n\n\n\n    // hide graph filter control programatically\n    document.querySelector('sz-wc-standalone-graph').showFiltersControl = false;\nGetting Started\nGetting set up to work with the Senzing SDK Components can be done in as little as 10 minutes if you already have an Senzing REST API Server installation running. \nSee the Quick Start Guide for instructions.\nCompatibility\nAny web page or application that can render web component tags can be enabled by adding the @senzing/sdk-components-web package to it's dependencies.

We could add things like api request proxy authentication, ssl, react app, electron shell etc. \nThis guide is meant purely to get you from zero to working example as quickly as possible.\nPreparation\nYou should set up a working directory, and initialize it.\nmkdir wc-example-spa && cd wc-example-spa\ngit init\nnpm init -yIf you get an error on git --version you don't have git installed. If you get an error on npm -v you do not have node installed. While you can run the components without either of these tools it's beyond the purposes of illustrating how to get things up and running quickly  ;)\n\nDownload NodeJS\nDownload Git\n\nInstallation\nnpm install @senzing/sdk-components-web --saveCreate an HTML document\nSo you can either create a html document from scratch or just grab one from the node_modules/@senzing/sdk-components-web/examples directory. For the sake of brevity I'm going to illustrate the latter option. Open up a terminal to your working project directory and type:\ncp -r node_modules/\\@senzing/sdk-components-web/examples/* ./This should copy all of the example .html files from the package in to your working directory.\nSet the components to your API Server address\nOpen up the example file and update the sz-wc-configuration tag, or add the following to the top of the document  tag contents:\nThis will tell the components to redirect all api server calls to localhost:8080. The next step will set up a redirect to forward any unresolved requests to your api server hostname.\nServe your HTML\nGo to your terminal and execute the following command. Replace the http://americium.local:8250 part with the address to your API Rest Server address.\nnpx http-server --proxy http://americium.local:8250By default http-server will run on localhost:8080, and any resources that it can't find will be redirected to the address specified in the --proxy parameter.\nNow open up localhost:8080 and browse to the file/example being worked on.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/web-components/examples.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/web-components/examples.html","title":"additional-page - Examples","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are Web Components ?\nWeb components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps.
