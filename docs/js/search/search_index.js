--save.\nAdd to app.module.ts\nNow open up your applications main module file, in most cases this will be app.module.ts for projects generated by angular-cli.\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { SenzingSdkModule } from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    SenzingSdkModule.forRoot()\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Now start up your application and start adding tags or referencing services. The simplest\n way to test that things are set up correctly is to add the static sz-powered-by tag\n to your applications html template.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n

injectable that can be used to dynamically change the global\nvalues that are passed throughout all components for API connection requests.\nThis service is provided for advanced usage where the connection parameters have to\nchange dynamically through the application lifecycle(ie changing request namespace from 'http://api.mydomain.com' to 'http://api.mydomain.com/SUBSECTION').\nIf your application just needs its values initialized that should be done by\npassing in a config factory to the SenzingSdkModule method.\n\n            \n\n\n            \n                Example\n

           Description\n            \n            \n                Provides a composite UI Event BUS / Preferences datastore.\nevery time a pref in the datastore is changed publishes a\n\"prefsChanged\" rxjs BehaviorSubject  that can be subscribed\nand responded to.\nwhen a component UI event happens(ie: user collapses all nodes in an entity detail section)\nthe component updates the corresponding value through this service.\nrepresentational state is published and responded to through this class.\nit is up to the end consumer what to do with this data. it is not stored anywhere\nother than in memory by default. the third example shows how to load from localstorage.\n\n            \n\n\n            \n                Example\n            \n            \n

for the Senzing® SDK components that can be used in other projects. There are two flavors that the components come in. The @senzing/sdk-components-ng package which is based around the Angular 10.x.x framework, and the @senzing/sdk-components-web package which is framework agnostic and based around the Web Components standard. The usage for both packages is noted in the documentation examples.\nFor information on the Web Components version see the sdk-components-web guide. \n\n\n\n\nDependencies\nFor building from Source:\n\nNode/NPM.\nAngular CLI\nTypeScript\n\nPlease see the installation instructions for each of these for how to install and setup each one properly.\nInstallation\nShortcuts\nIf you're developing on Windows or macOS, you can make use of the Senzing app\nto help populate an entity repository to test with.  It also gives you an easy way to load and browse data\noutside of the Senzing REST API Sever.  See the instructions\nfor using the Senzing App Integration Scripts\nto start the Senzing REST API Server using your existing projects in the Senzing app.\nREST API Server\nThese components require an implementation of the Senzing REST API\nto function.  You can use the Senzing REST API Server as a default\nimplementation in Java.  Follow the instructions to check out and\nbuild the Senzing REST API Sever from source or download a pre-built\nversion when available.\nSDK Components\nOpen a terminal window to the location of your project and type:\nnpm install @senzing/sdk-components-ng --save\nThe components will be added to your node_modules.\nPlease take note that all the same interfaces, and services from the @senzing/rest-api-client-ng package will also be available for convenience.\nUsage\nJust add the import statement for the particular component, service, or model that you want to use.\nimport {\n  SzEntitySearchParams,\n  SzAttributeSearchResult\n} from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';Quick Start\n1) Start up an instance of the Senzing REST API Server\nif not currently running.\nSee the README.md for instructions on how\nto start the Senzing REST API Server on the command line or with Docker.\n2) Add the SenzingSDKModule to your angular app's app.module.ts\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { SenzingSdkModule } from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    SenzingSdkModule.forRoot()\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }3) Check that components can be rendered correctly. Add the following to your app.component.html (or any template) and verify the result:\nThe result should be a powered by logo like the following:\n\nIf not then double check that step 2 is correct, and that you remembered to include the\nimport statement as well.\n4) Check that components can communicate with rest api gateway sucessfully. Add the following to your app.component.html(or any template):\nThe result should be a list of service configuration parameters and values.\n5) Load the engine with data to resolve. The easiest way to do this currently is to load a CSV using the\nSenzing app.  This can also be done through the\nSenzing REST API using the Senzing REST API Server.\n6) Verify that the components are working properly. The easiest way to do this is to is to just implement a search box, and a result list. Copy the following to your app.component.html file\n\nnow in your controller class (app.component.ts) add the onSearchResults and onSearchResultClick methods we just referenced above:\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport {\n  SzEntitySearchParams,\n  SzAttributeSearchResult\n} from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  title = 'senzing-sdk-consumer';\n  public currentSearchResults: SzAttributeSearchResult[];\n  public currentlySelectedEntityId: number;\n  public currentSearchParameters: SzEntitySearchParams;\n\n  onSearchResults(evt: SzAttributeSearchResult[]) {\n    console.log('@senzing/sz-search-results: ', evt);\n    // store on current scope\n    this.currentSearchResults = evt;\n    // results module is bound to this property\n  }\n\n  public onSearchResultClick(entityData: SzAttributeSearchResult) {\n    console.log('@senzing/sz-search-results-click: ', entityData);\n\n    if (entityData && entityData.entityId > 0) {\n      this.currentlySelectedEntityId = entityData.entityId;\n    }\n  }\n}Now, start up your standard Angular dev server (or maybe just restart for fun) via ng serve\nand you should be greeted by a page like with a search box. And search results list right below it.\n\nAnd that's it! At least for the quickstart. There are a ton more options for running the rest server, interacting with the components and services.\nConfiguration & Parameters\nThe SenzingSDKModule accepts a factory method that returns an instance of the\nSzRestConfiguration class. By adding a factory like the following to the forRoot method, you can change services configuration to point to non-default values.\nThe following tells any components to turn on CORS functionality and make all api requests to localhost port 8080 (i.e.: http://localhost:8080/).\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { SenzingSdkModule, SzRestConfiguration } from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n// create exportable factory  \n// for AOT compilation\nexport function SzRestConfigurationFactory() {\n  return new SzRestConfiguration({\n    basePath: 'http://localhost:8080',\n    withCredentials: true\n  });\n}\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    SenzingSdkModule.forRoot( SzRestConfigurationFactory )\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Parameters\nSee online documentation for a complete list of configuration parameters that can control the connection behavior of the sdk components.\nDocumentation\nInstallation contains a statically generated API and component references. They can be found in\nnode_modules/@senzing/sdk-components-ng/docs or Online here.\nExamples\nWhen you check out the source for this repository there is a directory of Angular project examples. Please see the Examples Readme for more information on how these work.\nTroubleshooting\nOccasionally something does go wrong (I know, I know right?). Here are some common things we run in to:\n\n  \n    \n      Problem\n      Solution\n      Explanation\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      messages like GET http://attribute-types/ net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED are\n      showing up in the developer console\n      \n        Set the api configuration to the address and port your rest server is running at by\n        passing in an instance of SzRestConfiguration to the SenzingSdkModule.forRoot method.\n        \n        Double check and make sure you can connect to your rest server via\n        curl -i http://localhost:8080/heartbeat\n      \n      \n        The api is trying to hit the rest server without an appropriate basepath or the hostname.\n      \n    \n    \n      npm run start throws weird \"No App Module\" error\n      recompile the npm package. \n      npm run build\n      For whatever reason sometimes the builder misses compiling packages. open up dist/@senzing/sdk-components/public_api.d.ts and check to make sure all the packages being referenced actually got compiled.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\n                             Apache License\n                       Version 2.0, January 2004\n                    http://www.apache.org/licenses/   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\nDefinitions.\n\"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,\nand distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.\n\"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by\nthe copyright owner that is granting the License.\n\"Legal Entity\" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all\nother entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common\ncontrol with that entity.

Custom components and widgets built on the Web Component standards, will work across modern browsers, and can be used with any JavaScript library or framework that work with HTML.\nFor more information on the subject see the following sites:\n\nWebComponents.org\nWeb Components | MDN\nBuilding Components | Web Fundamentals | Google Developers\n\nWeb Components Vs. Angular\n\nTag Attributes are kabob-case\nTag names are prefixed with sz-wc\nDOM events are camel-case\nDOM properties are camel-case\n\nAll Web Component tag names are prefixed with sz-wc. This is to prevent tag namespace collision/pollution. When browsing any of the online documentation examples, and you see a tag start with sz-, just remember if you are using the @senzing/sdk-components-web package your tag name should start with sz-wc instead.\nThe other main difference between the two implementations is that if using angular the attributes are Camel Case, and if using web components the attributes are kabob case. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Special_case_styles\nWhen accessing a method or setter through the DOM on a web component programatically however, you access the setter/method in camel case ie:\n\n\n\n    // hide graph filter control programatically\n    document.querySelector('sz-wc-standalone-graph').showFiltersControl = false;\nGetting Started\nGetting set up to work with the Senzing SDK Components can be done in as little as 10 minutes if you already have an Senzing REST API Server installation running. \nSee the Quick Start Guide for instructions.\nCompatibility\nAny web page or application that can render web component tags can be enabled by adding the @senzing/sdk-components-web package to it's dependencies. The basic requirement is that the application hosting the tags can parse javascript and supports rendering custom component tags. All modern web browsers, some mobile browsers, and any native applications that support embedded web views should be able to render these components.\nAdd the css file to your document:\nAdd the javascript to your document:\n\n  Note*\n  You may have to change the paths pointing to each of these files depending on how your application is layed out.

We could add things like api request proxy authentication, ssl, react app, electron shell etc. \nThis guide is meant purely to get you from zero to working example as quickly as possible.\nPreparation\nYou should set up a working directory, and initialize it.\nmkdir wc-example-spa && cd wc-example-spa\ngit init\nnpm init -yIf you get an error on git --version you don't have git installed. If you get an error on npm -v you do not have node installed. While you can run the components without either of these tools it's beyond the purposes of illustrating how to get things up and running quickly  ;)\n\nDownload NodeJS\nDownload Git\n\nInstallation\nnpm install @senzing/sdk-components-web --saveCreate an HTML document\nSo you can either create a html document from scratch or just grab one from the node_modules/@senzing/sdk-components-web/examples directory. For the sake of brevity I'm going to illustrate the latter option. Open up a terminal to your working project directory and type:\ncp -r node_modules/\\@senzing/sdk-components-web/examples/* ./This should copy all of the example .html files from the package in to your working directory.\nSet the components to your API Server address\nOpen up the example file and update the sz-wc-configuration tag, or add the following to the top of the document  tag contents:\nThis will tell the components to redirect all api server calls to localhost:8080. The next step will set up a redirect to forward any unresolved requests to your api server hostname.\nServe your HTML\nGo to your terminal and execute the following command. Replace the http://americium.local:8250 part with the address to your API Rest Server address.\nnpx http-server --proxy http://americium.local:8250By default http-server will run on localhost:8080, and any resources that it can't find will be redirected to the address specified in the --proxy parameter.\nNow open up localhost:8080 and browse to the file/example being worked on.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/web-components/examples.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/web-components/examples.html","title":"additional-page - Examples","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nWhat are Web Components ?\nWeb components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps.
