injectable that can be used to dynamically change the global\nvalues that are passed throughout all components for API connection requests.\nThis service is provided for advanced usage where the connection parameters have to\nchange dynamically through the application lifecycle(ie changing request namespace from 'http://api.mydomain.com' to 'http://api.mydomain.com/SUBSECTION').\nIf your application just needs its values initialized that should be done by\npassing in a config factory to the SenzingSdkModule method.\nthis.apiconf.basePath = 'http://apis.mydomain.com/';this.apiconf.parametersChanged.subscribe( (params) => { console.log('api connection params changed.', params); })\n            \n\n\n\n            \n    Index\n    \n

up to the end consumer what to do with this data. it is not stored anywhere\nother than in memory by default. the third example shows how to load from localstorage.\nconstructor(private prefs:

file.\nThe format is based on Keep a Changelog,\nmarkdownlint,\nand this project adheres to Semantic Versioning.\n[6.1.0] - 2023-09-06\nThe major feature being added for this release is the inclusion a a new \"How\" report component. The How api functions are meant to provide information on HOW records in an entity came together or were pushed apart during resolution. The Visual How component will illustrate the final entity and allow the user to walk back through the entities resolution steps, branching off when singletons are merged in or virtual entities are created from the result of previous record resolution steps.\nModified\n\nnew graph icons. see #499\nmatch keys are now shown by default in the graph. #496\nnew why and why not report column formatting to match g2Explorer. #558 #551\nwhy and why not datatransforms changed to match g2Explorer. #529\n\nAdded\n\n\"How\" entity report component(s) added. see #438\nAdded SzHowEntityComponent component which is the only component that should be used at an implementation level. The other components listed below are components that this component uses to create things like different color cards, nested trees, navigation, groups etc.\nAdded SzHowNavComponent component which is used to provide quick step jumping based on filter criteria.\nAdded SzHowStepNodeComponent component which represents a node in the step tree. Nodes are different that Steps since they can be other trees, groups, and recurse. Step nodes will contain SzHowStepCardComponent, SzHowStepStackComponent, SzHowFinalEntityCardComponent, SzHowSingletonCardComponent, and/or nested SzHowStepNodeComponent components.\nAdded SzHowStepStackComponent component which represents a collapsible group of ADD Record steps found in sequence.\nAdded SzHowStepCardBase which serves as a base class for card permutations.\nSzHowStepCardComponent is the card component representing a Add Record, Singleton, Merge, Interim.\nSzHowSingletonCardComponent represents a step or a non-resolved state with a single record that was not merged in.\nSzHowFinalEntityCardComponent represents the top level node for a final state in a tree.\n\n\n\n\n\"How\" UI service(SzHowUIService) that provides inter-op, eventing, and caching for different How components to use a shared service so things only need to be parsed/transformed once, and if something changes all the components can be notified etc.\n\nrelevant tickets: #438 #496 #499 #513 #516 #525 #527 #529 #531 #534 #538 #545 #547 #548 #551 #555 #557 #558 #565 #567 #571 #572 #574 #581\n[6.0.0] - 2023-01-20\nModified\n\nAngular Framework updated to version 15. As of 6.0.0 release this package now requires @angular@~15.0.0 to compile and run. Updating to angular 15 resolves major dependency compatibility issues so we can apply the latest security patches to the library. For information updating your project from a previous angular version to ~15.0.0 see the Angular Update Guide \nAngular Material updated to version 15. As of 6.0.0 release this package now requires v15 of angular material library. Since the compiled version of this package defines it's dependency as a peer dependency it's worth mentioning that your project will need to import it to function properly. ng add @angular/material@15.\nD3.js updated to version 7. version 5 was exposing a security defect in d3.color(see SNYK-JS-D3COLOR-1076592) that had no patches available until version 7. see #466\n\nRemoved\n\nforceSimulation property removed from SzRelationshipNetworkComponent base class. (no one should be directly using this anyways)\n\n[5.1.1] - 2022-10-31\nAdded\n\nAdded \"hide indirect links\" UI control to graph filtering component.\nAdded suppressL1InterLinks to graph preferences\nAdded linkColor to graph preferences\nAdded indirectLinkColor to graph preferences\nAdded Link Color section to graph filter component\nAdded Data Sources list to graph hover tooltip\nAdded \"Why Not\" button/report to \"Possible Matches\" section in the entity detail component.\n\nModified\n\nMatch keys on graph entity link(s) are now in a vertically centered multi-line list.\nBugfix for match key labels. (see #383)\nEntity detail embedded graph now defaults to collapsed nodes when relationships are \nshowMatchKeys UI/UX parameter renamed to showLinkLabels to avoid confusion with matchKeyFilters and showMatchKeyTokens which are functional/behavior parameters.\nGraph api call pattern changed to an initial entity request followed by a minimal entity-networks call to retrieve the necessary data. This new surface pattern dramatically decreases the time needed to initially render a graph with a large about of relationships.\nGraph entity name label no longer clips with ellipsis.\nGraph entity name now performs a hard word wrap to display the full name on multiple lines\n\nrelevant tickets: #309 #364 #383 #407 #413 #414 #415 #416 #417 #422 #423 #432 #433 #436 #439\n[5.1.0] - 2022-07-27\n\nthere is now a new unlimited ui option for maximum entities allowed.\nthere is now a new unlimited ui option for maximum build out allowed.\nthe upper limit of the maximum entities ui slider is now dynamically set from the initial query.\nmatch key token counts now feature condensed notation instead of ellipsis.\n\nAdded\n\nthe following event emitters added to SzGraphFilterComponent\nmatchKeyTokenSelectionScopeChanged when the user switches from CORE to EXTRANEOUS match key token scope\n\n\nthe following getters and setters added to SzGraphFilterComponent\nmaxEntitiesLimit the maximum value that the slider control will allow. default is 200.\nunlimitedMaxEntities ignore the maxEntities value and always pull up to 40000\nunlimitedMaxScope ignore the buildOut value and always pull up to 10\n\n\nthe following getters and setters added to SzGraphComponent\nunlimitedMaxEntities\nunlimitedMaxScope\nmaxEntitiesFilterLimit\n\n\nthe following event emitters on SzGraphComponent\nrenderStarted not sure why this didn't exist since renderComplete did\ndataLoading for more flexible state sensing\nonPreflightRequestComplete so we can get the total relationship count to populate the maxEntitiesFilterLimit\n\n\nthe following properties/getters/setters added to SzRelationshipNetworkComponent\nnoMaxEntitiesLimit sets whether or not to ignore the value set in maxEntities\nnoMaxScopeLimit sets whether or not to ignore the value set in buildOut\n\n\nthe following event emitters added to SzRelationshipNetworkComponent\nonTotalRelationshipsCountUpdated is emitted with the value of how many total relationships are possible to display according to the data in the focal entities related entities.\nrenderStarted wasn't wired correctly. works now\ndataLoading when a data request has been initiated.\ndataLoaded which is like requestComplete but instead of a boolean it returns the data response\n\n\nthe following preferences added to SzGraphPrefs\nunlimitedMaxEntities\nunlimitedMaxScope\n\n\ngetEntitiesByIds method added to SzSearchService to get data for multiple entities by their id's in the form of Observable\n\nModified\n\nChanged the behavior of showCoreMatchKeyTokenChips to automatically set matchKeyTokenSelectionScope to CORE.\nChanged the complete match key display to a comma deliminated list of tokens on each line for readability\nChanged the shouldDataSourceBeDisplayed method in SzGraphFilterComponent to allow for passing an empty array to showDataSources so we can initialize with an empty list that will prevent showing datasources before the list is ready.\nChanged the SzStandaloneGraphComponent component to initialize the value of showDataSources in the filter component to NOT initially show data sources until the data can be properly rendered. (prevents FOC, see above)\nthe following getters and setters added to SzGraphFilterComponent\nmaxEntities the maximum number of entities to display on the graph\n\n\nthe following changes made to SzRelationshipNetworkComponent\ndataRequested changed to BehaviorSubject (lifecycle bugfix)\nrequestStarted fixed\nrequestComplete fixed\ngetNetwork signature changed to getNetwork(entityIds: SzEntityIdentifier[], maxDegrees: number, buildOut: number, maxEntities: number)\nthe following event emitters have been rewired so that they are just proxies of \nthe observeable event streams for uniformity/reliability:\nonRequestStarted\nonRequestCompleted\nonRenderStarted\nonRenderCompleted\nonNoResults\nonDataRequested\nonDataLoaded\nonDataUpdated\nscaleChanged\n\n\n\n\n\nrelevant tickets: #343 #344 #347 #348 #350 #355 #358\n[5.0.0] - 2022-07-01\nThis release adds new functionality around expanding and collapsing related entities in Network Graph related components. We've moved the @senzing/sdk-graph-components to the scope of this package for easier maintenance and installation(now you just need this package instead of two). We're also adding the Why Not component that can be embedded between two or more entities to generate a report to show why two entities/records did not resolve.\nAdded\n\nThe SzWhyEntitiesComparisonComponent added for doing WHY comparison between entities. Adds the ability to run \"Why Not\" Reports from within the context of the search results and graph. \nThe following input parameters added to SzSearchResultsComponent:\nshowWhyComparisonButton

There are two flavors that the components come in. The @senzing/sdk-components-ng package which is based around the Angular 13.x.x framework, and the @senzing/sdk-components-web package which is framework agnostic and based around the Web Components standard. The usage for both packages is noted in the documentation examples.\nFor information on the Web Components version see the sdk-components-web guide. \n\n\n\n\nDependencies\nFor building from Source:\n\nNode/NPM.\nAngular CLI\nTypeScript\n\nPlease see the installation instructions for each of these for how to install and setup each one properly.\nInstallation\nShortcuts\nIf you're developing on Windows or macOS, you can make use of the Senzing app\nto help populate an entity repository to test with.  It also gives you an easy way to load and browse data\noutside of the Senzing REST API Sever.  See the instructions\nfor using the Senzing App Integration Scripts\nto start the Senzing REST API Server using your existing projects in the Senzing app.\nREST API Server\nThese components require an implementation of the Senzing REST API\nto function.  You can use the Senzing REST API Server as a default\nimplementation in Java.  Follow the instructions to check out and\nbuild the Senzing REST API Sever from source or download a pre-built\nversion when available.\nSDK Components\nOpen a terminal window to the location of your project and type:\nng add @angular/material\nng add @senzing/sdk-components-ng\nThe components package, along with any missing dependencies will be added to your project. \nAlternatively you can install the components and dependencies without the angular-cli via npm individually:\nnpm i @angular/material @angular/cdk @senzing/sdk-components-ng --save\nPlease take note that all the same interfaces, and services from the @senzing/rest-api-client-ng package will also be available for convenience.\nUsage\nJust add the import statement for the particular component, service, or model that you want to use.\nimport {\n  SzEntitySearchParams,\n  SzAttributeSearchResult\n} from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';Quick Start\n1) Start up an instance of the Senzing REST API Server\nif not currently running.\nSee the README.md for instructions on how\nto start the Senzing REST API Server on the command line or with Docker.\n2) Add the SenzingSDKModule to your angular app's app.module.ts\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { SenzingSdkModule } from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    SenzingSdkModule.forRoot()\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }3) Check that components can be rendered correctly. Add the following to your app.component.html (or any template) and verify the result:\nThe result should be a powered by logo like the following:\n\nIf not then double check that step 2 is correct, and that you remembered to include the\nimport statement as well.\n4) Check that components can communicate with rest api gateway sucessfully. Add the following to your app.component.html(or any template):\nThe result should be a list of service configuration parameters and values.\n5) Load the engine with data to resolve. The easiest way to do this currently is to load a CSV using the\nSenzing app.  This can also be done through the\nSenzing REST API using the Senzing REST API Server.\n6) Verify that the components are working properly. The easiest way to do this is to is to just implement a search box, and a result list. Copy the following to your app.component.html file\n\nnow in your controller class (app.component.ts) add the onSearchResults and onSearchResultClick methods we just referenced above:\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport {\n  SzEntitySearchParams,\n  SzAttributeSearchResult\n} from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  title = 'senzing-sdk-consumer';\n  public currentSearchResults: SzAttributeSearchResult[];\n  public currentlySelectedEntityId: number;\n  public currentSearchParameters: SzEntitySearchParams;\n\n  onSearchResults(evt: SzAttributeSearchResult[]) {\n    console.log('@senzing/sz-search-results: ', evt);\n    // store on current scope\n    this.currentSearchResults = evt;\n    // results module is bound to this property\n  }\n\n  public onSearchResultClick(entityData: SzAttributeSearchResult) {\n    console.log('@senzing/sz-search-results-click: ', entityData);\n\n    if (entityData && entityData.entityId > 0) {\n      this.currentlySelectedEntityId = entityData.entityId;\n    }\n  }\n}Now, start up your standard Angular dev server (or maybe just restart for fun) via ng serve\nand you should be greeted by a page like with a search box. And search results list right below it.\n\nAnd that's it! At least for the quickstart. There are a ton more options for running the rest server, interacting with the components and services.\nConfiguration & Parameters\nThe SenzingSDKModule accepts a factory method that returns an instance of the\nSzRestConfiguration class. By adding a factory like the following to the forRoot method, you can change services configuration to point to non-default values.\nThe following tells any components to turn on CORS functionality and make all api requests to localhost port 8080 (i.e.: http://localhost:8080/).\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { SenzingSdkModule, SzRestConfiguration } from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n// create exportable factory  \n// for AOT compilation\nexport function SzRestConfigurationFactory() {\n  return new SzRestConfiguration({\n    basePath: 'http://localhost:8080',\n    withCredentials: true\n  });\n}\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    SenzingSdkModule.forRoot( SzRestConfigurationFactory )\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Parameters\nSee online documentation for a complete list of configuration parameters that can control the connection behavior of the sdk components.\nDocumentation\nInstallation contains a statically generated API and component references.

pages and web apps. Custom components and widgets built on the Web Component standards, will work across modern browsers, and can be used with any JavaScript library or framework that work with HTML.\nFor more information on the subject see the following sites:\n\nWebComponents.org\nWeb Components | MDN\nBuilding Components | Web Fundamentals | Google Developers\n\nWeb Components Vs. Angular\n\nTag Attributes are kabob-case\nTag names are prefixed with sz-wc\nDOM events are camel-case\nDOM properties are camel-case\n\nAll Web Component tag names are prefixed with sz-wc. This is to prevent tag namespace collision/pollution. When browsing any of the online documentation examples, and you see a tag start with sz-, just remember if you are using the @senzing/sdk-components-web package your tag name should start with sz-wc instead.\nThe other main difference between the two implementations is that if using angular the attributes are Camel Case, and if using web components the attributes are kabob case. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Special_case_styles\nWhen accessing a method or setter through the DOM on a web component programatically however, you access the setter/method in camel case ie:\n\n\n\n    // hide graph filter control programatically\n    document.querySelector('sz-wc-standalone-graph').showFiltersControl = false;\nGetting Started\nGetting set up to work with the Senzing SDK Components can be done in as little as 10 minutes if you already have an Senzing REST API Server installation running. \nSee the Quick Start Guide for instructions.\nCompatibility\nAny web page or application that can render web component tags can be enabled by adding the @senzing/sdk-components-web package to it's dependencies. The basic requirement is that the application hosting the tags can parse javascript and supports rendering custom component tags. All modern web browsers, some mobile browsers, and any native applications that support embedded web views should be able to render these components.\nAdd the css file to your document:\nAdd the javascript to your document:\n\n  Note*\n  You may have to change the paths pointing to each of these files depending on how your application is layed out.

We could add things like api request proxy authentication, ssl, react app, electron shell etc. \nThis guide is meant purely to get you from zero to working example as quickly as possible.\nPreparation\nYou should set up a working directory, and initialize it.\nmkdir wc-example-spa && cd wc-example-spa\ngit init\nnpm init -yIf you get an error on git --version you don't have git installed. If you get an error on npm -v you do not have node installed. While you can run the components without either of these tools it's beyond the purposes of illustrating how to get things up and running quickly  ;)\n\nDownload NodeJS\nDownload Git\n\nInstallation\nnpm install @senzing/sdk-components-web --saveCreate an HTML document\nSo you can either create a html document from scratch or just grab one from the node_modules/@senzing/sdk-components-web/examples directory. For the sake of brevity I'm going to illustrate the latter option. Open up a terminal to your working project directory and type:\ncp -r node_modules/\\@senzing/sdk-components-web/examples/* ./This should copy all of the example .html files from the package in to your working directory.\nSet the components to your API Server address\nOpen up the example file and update the sz-wc-configuration tag, or add the following to the top of the document  tag contents:\nThis will tell the components to redirect all api server calls to localhost:8080. The next step will set up a redirect to forward any unresolved requests to your api server hostname.\nServe your HTML\nGo to your terminal and execute the following command. Replace the http://americium.local:8250 part with the address to your API Rest Server address.\nnpx http-server --proxy http://americium.local:8250By default http-server will run on localhost:8080, and any resources that it can't find will be redirected to the address specified in the --proxy parameter.\nNow open up localhost:8080 and browse to the file/example being worked on.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/web-components/examples.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/web-components/examples.html","title":"additional-page - Examples","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are Web Components ?\nWeb components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps.

You'll almost certainly want to create your own, or tweak things to match your application's styling as needed. The compiled css files are located in the styles/themes directory in the package being used.\nusing SASS\nif you're using sass(and scss processor can reference node_modules), open up your main scss file(src/styles.scss in default angular layout) and include the following.\n@import '@senzing/sdk-components-ng/styles/themes/senzing.css';using CSS\nthere are several different ways to include a pre-built theme in your project.\nYou could just add the stylesheet path to your main html file and include the css reference in the HEAD of your document.\nfor production it is recommended you copy the theme stylesheet you will be using over to a static directory(probably a bad idea to leave node_modules open to the world) and change the above reference to point to it's location. \nAngular projects\nif you're using the sdk components in the scope of an angular project the recommended way is to add the theme file path to your angular.json file for your project.\n\n\nfind the _architect.build.options.styles node in the file, and add the path there. \n\"styles\": [\n  \"src/styles.scss\",\n  \"node_modules/\\\\@senzing/sdk-components-ng/styles/themes/drab.css\"\n],and next time you run or build your angular project it will include the theme file for the sdk components.\n\n  Note*\n  Windows users have to deal with _escaping_ escape charaters when directly accessing npm namespaced paths.\n  (illustrated above) \n\n\n\nThemes\n\n\n\n  \n    Drab\n    location: \n      node_modules/@senzing/sdk-components-ng/styles/themes/drab.css\n      \n  \n  \n    Senzing\n    location: \n      node_modules/@senzing/sdk-components-ng/styles/themes/senzing.css\n      \n  \n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/themes/customizing.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/themes/customizing.html","title":"additional-page - Customizing","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomizing Themes\nsdk-components-ng and sdk-components-web both make use of CSS Variables for styling.
