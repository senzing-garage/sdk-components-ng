component are split up. this is done for some practical reasons. most noteably, so results can be placed wherever it makes sense to put them. This does complicate set up a tiny bit, but the tradeoff in flexibility is well worth it.\nSo, lets get down to business.\nlets bind the output of the search component to the input of the search results component.\nfirst add a method to your component(or app.component.ts) that will handle the output:\nonSearchResults(evt: SzSearchResults) {\n    console.log('@senzing/sdk-components-ng/sz-search/searchResults: ', evt);\n    // store on current scope\n    this.currentSearchResults = evt;\n    // results module is bound to this property\n  }now lets bind the sz-search tag to the method we just created. Add the following to your app.component.html file:\n\n\nthe attribute in parens just tells angular that it's an event and not just an attribute.\n\n    \n\n    \n        import { AfterViewInit,

window to the location of your project and typenpm install @senzing/service-rest-http --save\nComponents\nopen a terminal window to the location of your project and typenpm install @senzing/sdk-components-ng --save\n  \nDependencies\nthese components are dependent on a rest api gateway to forward requests from the \nweb application to the g2 instance and back. \nNode should install this for you when you install this package. If it doesn't, or \nyou just want to look through it's documentation you can find it Here.\n  \nQuick Start\nAfter installation you will need to do a few more things.\n1) Start up an instance of the @senzing/service-rest-http by running the following \n   from the application root. \njava -jar node_modules/@senzing/service-rest-http/http.jar   \n2) Add the SenzingSDKModule to your angular app's app.module.ts \nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { SenzingSdkModule, SzRestConfiguration } from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    SenzingSdkModule\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }   \n3) Check that components can be rendered correctly. Add the following to your app.component.html(or any template) and verify the result: \nThe result should be a powered by logo like the following:\n\n\npowered by\n\n    \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n    \n\n\n\nIf not then double check that step 2 is correct, and that you remembered to include the \nimport statement as well.\n \n \n\n4) Check that components can communicate with rest api gateway sucessfully. Add the following to your app.component.html(or any template) : \nThe result should be a list of service configuration parameters and values.\n5) Load the engine with data to resolve. \n   The sdk ships with some example data that can be loaded in to the engine. An example of how to do that  is below:\n   5.1) TODO\n6) Verify that the components are working properly. The easiest way to do this is to is to just implement a search box, and a result list. Copy the following to your app.component.html file\n\nnow in your controller class(app.component.ts) add the onSearchResults and onSearchResultClick methods we just referenced above:\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { SzSearchResults, SzSearchResultEntityData, SzEntitySearchParams } from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  title = 'senzing-sdk-consumer';\n  public currentSearchResults: SzSearchResults;\n  public currentlySelectedEntityId = 4068;\n  public currentSearchParameters: SzEntitySearchParams;\n\n  onSearchResults(evt: SzSearchResults) {\n    console.log('@senzing/sz-search-results: ', evt);\n    // store on current scope\n    this.currentSearchResults = evt;\n    // results module is bound to this property\n  }\n\n  public onSearchResultClick(entityData: SzSearchResultEntityData) {\n    console.log('@senzing/sz-search-results-click: ', entityData);\n\n    if (entityData && entityData.entityId > 0) {\n      this.currentlySelectedEntityId = entityData.entityId;\n    }\n  }\n}   \nConfiguration & Parameters\nConfiguration\nThe SenzingSDKModule accepts a factory method or a object literal that conforms to the \nproperties found in the SzRestConfiguration class. By adding a factory like the following to the constructor method, you can change services configuration to point to non-default values.\nThe following tells any components to make api requests to http://localhost:22080/api/\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { SenzingSdkModule, SzRestConfiguration } from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    SenzingSdkModule.forRoot(() => {\n      return new SzRestConfiguration({\n        basePath: \"http://localhost:22080/api/\",\n        withCredentials: false\n      })\n    })\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { } \nParameters\n  \n      \n              \n                  \n                      Properties\n                  \n              \n              \n                  \n                      \n                          \n                                  Optional\n                              accessToken\n                          \n                          \n                                  Optional\n                              apiKeys\n                          \n                          \n                                  Optional\n                              basePath\n                          \n                          \n                                  Optional\n                              hostName\n                          \n                          \n                                  Optional\n                              password\n                          \n                          \n                                  Optional\n                              portNum\n                          \n                          \n                                  Optional\n                              username\n                          \n                          \n                                  Optional\n                              withCredentials\n                          \n                      \n                  \n              \n              \n                  \n                      Methods\n                  \n              \n              \n                  \n                      \n                          \n                                  Public\n                              isJsonMime\n                          \n                          \n                                  Public\n                              selectHeaderAccept\n                          \n                          \n                                  Public\n                              selectHeaderContentType\n                          \n                      \n                  \n              \n      \n  \n\n\nDocumentation\nInstallation contains a statically generated API and component references.

Quick Start","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\nPrerequisites\nBefore you begin, make sure your development environment includes Node.js® and an npm package manager.\nNode.js\nAngular and this specific SDK package requires Node.js version 8.x or 10.x.\nIf you are looking for the Web Component version of this package it can be found here\n\nTo check your version, run node -v in a terminal/console window.\nTo get Node.js, go to nodejs.org.\n\nnpm package manager\nAngular, the Angular CLI, and Angular apps depend on features and functionality provided by libraries that are available as npm packages. To download and install npm packages, you must have an npm package manager.\nThis Quick Start uses the npm client command line interface, which is installed with Node.js by default.\nTo check that you have the npm client installed, run npm -v in a terminal/console window.\nInstall JAVA/JDK x.x\nTODO: find instructions for setting up jdk\nInstall Maven x.x (Optional)\nIf you want to build the rest server from source you will need to install JDK version x.x.x\nFollow Directions on http://maven.apache.org/install.html\nInstall Angular and Angular-Cli 7.1.4\nThis Quick Start makes use of the angular cli tool to automatically set up an angular project and provide tooling. This can be done without the cli tool as well, but for purposes of simplifying the examples it is what we're going to use in this walkthrough.\nTo install the CLI using npm, open a terminal/console window and enter the following command:\nnpm install -g @angular/cliInstall Senzing HTTP Services and SDK\nLocate or Create G2.ini\nThe library will initialize with this configuration file. This configuration file initializes the g2 engine pointing to a specific project. \nVia Application\nIf you have already installed the application it will be located in either \n*%%LocalAppData%%\\Senzing\\Workbench\\project_{PROJECT_ID}\\ or \nTODO: find osx link\nThis application will also install any support libraries, and create the initial g2.ini for you.\nFor Enterprise\nTODO: instructions from g2 api documentation.\nSenzing REST Api (pre-built)\nnpm install @senzing/rest-api-server-java --save-devnow start up the rest server with:\njava -Djava.library.path=\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Senzing\\\\g2\\\\lib\" -jar node_modules/@senzing/rest-api-server-java/sz-api-server-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -iniFile \"%%LocalAppData%%\\Senzing\\Workbench\\project_{PROJECT_ID}\\g2.ini\"Senzing REST HTTP (from source)\nDownload and Register G2.jar\nTODO: instructions for this.\nmvn install:install-file -Dfile=./g2.jar -DgroupId=com.senzing -DartifactId=g2 -Dversion=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jarBuild Server\ngit clone git@github.com:Senzing/rest-api-server-java.git\nmvn clean install\njava -Djava.library.path=\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Senzing\\\\g2\\\\lib\" -jar target/sz-api-server-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -iniFile \"%%LocalAppData%%\\Senzing\\Workbench\\project_{PROJECT_ID}\\g2.ini\"Create new Angular Project\nng new senzing-sdk-demo --style=scss\ncd senzing-sdk-demoIf you're already working with a Angular 7.x.x Project you can skip ahead to the next section.\nSenzing SDK Componenents\nnpm install @senzing/sdk-components-ngConfiguration\nREST Service\nThe Rest service must be configured with a port number and hostname. you will use this same network address info for the next step as well.\nStart up the service\ncd node_modules/@senzing/service-http-rest\njava -jar g2-webapp-servletBy default the http rest server will start on the local interface on port 22080. for the sake of this guide we will assume that you are running the rest server on this address. If you change the port number or are hosting the http server on a machine different from the machine you are following this walkthrough on please replace http://localhost:22080 with the relevant hostname and port number.\nLoad in some data\nLets load in some stub data for the purposes of demonstrating that our rest service is operating in the expected manner. Gotta have something to search through right? \nlets fire up another console window and load in some data.\ncd node_modules/@senzing/service-http-rest\nnode loader.js --file=./demo-data/1.csvSDK Components\nThe SDK components have to know the network address information of where the HTTP services are running to communicate. There are a number of ways to do this:\n\nAt run time, injected in to the sdkModule's constructor.\nAt run time, by calling the sz-configuration component with the properties as attributes.\nBefore run time, by modifying the SDK Service's api.configuration.json file.\nBefore run time, by using a reverse proxy.\n\n\n1) As Module constructor parameters\nOpen up your application's app.module.ts file and add the SDK imports(SenzingSdkModule, and SzRestConfiguration)\nimport { SenzingSdkModule, SzRestConfiguration } from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';Now add the SenzingSdkModule to your applications imports. You can pass in the API configuration parameters inline(shown below) or via any factory method that constructs a SzRestConfiguration object. Your application's NgModule declaration should look something like this below:\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    SenzingSdkModule.forRoot(() => {\n      return new SzRestConfiguration({\n        basePath: \"/api/\",        \n        withCredentials: false\n      })\n    })\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\n\n2) Using the configuration Tag\nthe senzing sdk can be configured at run time to point to the location of where the rest service is running this can be done through the configuration tag:\n\n4) Reverse Proxy (for development)\nFor the easiest set up possible you may want to use angular-cli's built in reverse proxy support. This is not recommended for production deployment. By using the reverse proxy, you can temporarily avoid any security issues that will be present in production implementations. To do this type the following in a terminal window from your angular project's root:\necho '{\"api\": {\"target\": \"http://localhost:22080/workbench/\", \"secure\": false }}' > proxy.conf.jsonnow add(or just update if already present) the following to your npm package.json start script:\n\"start\":\"ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json\"\nNow anytime you serve the angular application via npm start it will start up the angular development server with a built-in reverse proxy from http://localhost:4200/api/**/* -> http://localhost:22080/workbench/*\nAdd SDK Module to application\nopen up your app's entry point module declaration, this is usually located in src/app/app.module.ts\nand add the following to it's imports. If you've already done this in the previous step, or are using the web component(s) feel free to skip ahead to the html markup step.\nimport { SenzingSdkModule } from '@senzing/sdk-components-ng';now add the SenzingSdkModule to the components imports property:\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    SenzingSdkModule\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})we should edit our app's template to pull in some SDK components. lets add the \"powered by senzing\" component just to make sure our angular app can pull in and render components from the sdk first.\nOpen up the app.component.html and replace the content with the following:\n\n  \n  \nnow lets start up the angular dev server\nng serveyou should see a white background with the senzing logo in the top center of the page and a small table of service configuration and datasource properties(pictured below). If you do not then something is wrong. Re-read the steps above and double check that you didn't miss anything.\nUsage\nplease see api documentation for specific language implementation examples and usage. \n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/themes.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/themes.html","title":"additional-page - Themes","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThemes\nPre-Built\nsee the docs for more information.\nCustom\nsee the docs for more information.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/themes/pre-built.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/themes/pre-built.html","title":"additional-page - Pre Built","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre Defined\nWe've included some pre-built themes for quick usage to get you up and running. You'll almost certainly want to create your own, or tweak things to match your application's styling as needed. The compiled css files are located in the styles/themes directory in the package being used.\nusing sass\nif you're using sass(and scss processor can reference node_modules), open up your main scss file(src/styles.scss in default angular layout) and include the following.\n@import '@senzing/sdk-components-ng/styles/themes/senzing.css';using css\nthere are several different ways to include a pre-built theme in your project.\nYou could just add the stylesheet path to your main html file and include the css reference in the HEAD of your document.\nfor production it is recommended you copy the theme stylesheet you will be using over to a static directory(probably a bad idea to leave node_modules open to the world) and change the above reference to point to it's location. \nangular projects\n\nif you're using the sdk components in the scope of an angular project the recommended way is to add the theme file path to your *angular.json* file for your project.\n\nfind the _architect.build.options.styles node in the file, and add the path there. \n\"styles\": [\n  \"src/styles.scss\",\n  \"node_modules/\\\\@senzing/sdk-components-ng/styles/themes/drab.css\"\n],and next time you run or build your angular project it will include the theme file for the sdk components.\n\n  Note*\n  Windows users have to deal with _escaping_ escape charaters when directly accessing npm namespaced paths.\n  (illustrated above) \n\n\n\nThemes\n\n  \n  \n    Drab\n    location: `node_modules/@senzing/sdk-components-ng/styles/themes/drab.css`\n  \n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/themes/customizing.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/themes/customizing.html","title":"additional-page - Customizing","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomizing Themes\nsdk-components-ng and sdk-components-web both make use of CSS Variables for styling.
